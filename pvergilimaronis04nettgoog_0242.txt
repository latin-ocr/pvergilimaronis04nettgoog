BUCOLIC POETS OF· ROME. 125

tres which first mede him jeslous Iolss promises to repert it, sud is
rewarded st the ssme moment by the sight oi his heder, which he
kindly sets down ss su orneu oi his friends success.

The fourth Eclogne, Caesar, is sgsiu politicsl. Meliboeus, the shep-
herd·poet‘s patron, finds Corydon meditsting s more theu rustic song
in prsise oi Csesur, s design in which his younger brother Amyntss is
uiso sumone to join. The petron reminds Corydon thst he hed olteu
wsrned his brother ugsimt the thriftless occupetion oi singing, und is
told thot it is his own kindness which hus plsoed thern both sbove
went, end hos given thom the cresus of thinking of such pursuits. Ae
the lines msy, perhsps, possess some biographicel interest, though the
imuges sre obviously horrowed irem Virgil's iirst Eclogne, it msy be
worth while to quote them, by wsy oi s specimen oi the poet’s msuner:

“ Hsec ego, confiteor, dixi, Meliboee: sed olim:
Non eedem nobis runt tempore, non Deus idem:
Spes megs sdridet Certe ue irsgs rubosque
Colligerem, viridique semem solerer hibisco,

'l'u iscis, et tus nos siit indulgentis turre,
Tu. nostrus miseratus opes docilemque iuvenum,
Hiberus prohibes ieiunis solvere lego.
uoce nihil querulum per te, Meliboee, sonemus,
Per te secure ssturi recubamus in umbre,
ut fruimur silvis Amaryllidos, ultime nuper
Litore terrerum, uisi tu, Meliboee, fuisses,
[iltius visuri, trucibusque obnoxie Mauris
Psscuo (lenonis, liquidis nbi curribus iugens
Dicitur occiduus impellere Boetis burense. ⁴
Scilicet extremo nunc silis in orbe iacerem,
A dolori et pecudes intsr'conductus Iberes
Inrits septeno modulsrer sibile muns,
Nec quisquam nostres intur durneto Cemenss
Respicerst, nou ipse duret mihi iorsitun eurem,

’ Ipso Dens, escuem, longeque sonsutiu votu
Scilicet extremo nou exaudiret in orbs.”

Meliboeus, siler deprecuting un expression iu which Corydon spps-
rently speaks cf himself se successor oi the greet Tityrus (doubtless
virgil), consents tc listen to eu smcebesn song from the brothers in
honour of the emperor. They invoke Caesar, epesi: oi his superhumeu
power in csiming the woods, rendering the cattle prolific, und fertilizing
the conntry,of the ireedom to dig tressure sud celebrate rursl festivities,
sud the geuersl security enjoyed under his reign, end tinelly hope thut
this Deity msy live oud rule for ever on esrth. Meliboeus eompliments
them ou the improvement in their siuging which the change oi subject
hus produced, snd Corydon in return hopes thet he will prove s second
Mseceuss to s second Virgil, introducing him to the imperial city, sud
bidding him rise from rnrul tc murtisl strsins.
