Varius may hove inspired Virgil with the love oi epie aud traged
It is ourious that before he began the Eologues he attempted opos
on Roman history, bnt found the subject uncongeuial to bis th
irame oi mind.l

The Ciceronian age, barren oi spic, tragedy‚ and comedy, had p1
duced only lyrio, didactic, and learned poetry. Virgil's youth u
passed nuder the direct iuduence oi the Alexandrian school end
followers iu Italy; with Cornelius Gallus,0ne oithe most distinguisb
among the ‘¹ cantores Euphorionis,” he was on terms oi intim:
friendship.² It is remarkable how Virgil’s genius aud tact euab'
him to avoid the characteristic faults oi the Alexandrinus and th
imitatore. Non laic te carmine ficio Atque per ombapes et loayo eoo
teneto. Their merite he makes hie own, their retinement and th
beauty; but there ie nothing to show that he had ever anytaste
the obscurity and affectation aud love of recondite mythology wh
Catullus and Propertius and probably Cinna allowed to blemish mi
of their writing.

Before the year 41 11, Virgil had been fortunate enough to win
friendship ol Asinius Pollio,¹³ whom he mentions in the third Eclo
as encouraging his attempta in the way of pastoral poetry, as well
that of Cornelius Gallus and Alienus Varus. Pollio was leyotw
Gallia Cisalpina in 43 u.e.; whether Virgil knew him before thi
not certain. When tho troubles of the year 41 came, and virgil,
Propertius and Tibullus, was ejected from his estate, the influenc·

it e hard tasi( to silence the complaints oi the ejected landowr
without giving dangerons offence to his veterans.⁴
