420 ΟΝ THE LATER

Continuo saltu nansoendens fervida nouae
Vincla, rapit rictu primum portetque cubili,

Mox alium, mox deiude alium: sio conscia mater
Segregot egregiam subolem virtutis amore.”

The rest of the poem is occupied partly with horsea, the points oi a
good horse and the training which he requires being described in the
manner, though not quite with the felicity, oi the Third Georgia,
partly with huntiug implements; efter which wa are dismissed to the
cheae rather abruptly:

“ liis ita dispositis hiemis sub tempus aquosae
, Incipe velocis catulos inmittere pratis,
Inoipe cornipedes latos agitare per agros:
Veuemur‚ dnm mane uorum, dnm mollia prata
Nocturnis odota feris vestigia servant”

Two fragmenta of a poem on Fowliug (Iceotioo or Da Aucupio)
were printed in a Dialogus on Birds (1544) by Gibertns Longolins
who asserted that they had been transcribed for him from a copy oi a
worlr by Nemesianus existing in a library at Bologna. Werdsdori‚ in
opposition to Ulitiua, thinks them uot unworthy oi their reputed
author: but in any cese they need not detain us further.

une elder Pliny, in two passages oi hie Natural History,¹ speaks oi
a poem by Ovid, eutitlad Holieatico. A fragment on that subject with
Orid's name attached to it is found iu a MS. containing part of
Gratius’ Oynegetica, and has been frequently printed in editions oi

Gratius aud Nemesianus, or as part oi Ovid’e worlrs. It would perhaps
be too much to asaigu it to such illustriore parentage, though Haupt
thinks otherwise: hut it would not disgrace either oi the two poete
whom wa hare just been consideriug. Talion specimen.

“At contra seopulis enneli corpore segnis
Polypus haeret, et hae eludit retia fraude,
lit sub lege loci sumit mutatque colorem,
Semper ei similis quem contigit: atque uhi praedam
Pendentem saetis sudus repit, hio quoque tellit
Elnto calamo, cnm demum emersus iu auras
Bracchia dissolvit, populatumque exspuit hamum.
At mugil cauda pendentem everberat escam
Excussamque legit Lupus aori concitus ira
Discursu fertur vario, tinctusque terentis
Prosequitur, quassatque caput, dum volnere saevus
Laxato cadat hamus, et ora patentia linquat”

Another fragment with the same argument was published by Hiero-
nymus Columna in his Commentary on the Fragments oi Ennius,

⁸ Book ³2, chaps. 2 and 11.
