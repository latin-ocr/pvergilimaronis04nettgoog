IN TRODUOTION . 15

decline had hegnu3 and Tibullus and Propertius, though iree from his
inulte, are scarcely of sufficient eminence ιο ιο regarded as masters in
the school οι style. But Virgil and Horace, like Sophocles among
Greek poete, constitute the type by which we estimato the poetioal ert
ot their oetion, the mean which every thing else either exceeds or falls
short of. It is not that we consciously lix upon any qualities in them

which sttraot our admiration, but rather perhaps, on the contrary, that
there seeum ιο ιο nothing prominent about them 3 the various requisites
oi excellence are harmonicusly blended, without exaggeretiou, eud the
mind receives that satisfaction which refuses to ιο selred how it came to
pass. Their style is sufficieutly characteristic not ιο repel imitatiou,
though with many oi its most successful imitatore the process is doubt-
less mainly intuitive: yet, ou the other haud, it is not so peculiar ss ιο

render imitation an act oi ridiculose presumption. Leee frequently
pictoriel thau thet which preceded it, the style of Lucretius aud Catullus,
it is at the sometime more artistic ε single sentences are not devoted to
the uuiiorm development of a particular effect, but a series of impres·
aiom is produced by appeals made apparently without any principle ot
sequence to the different elemeuts οι ιιο mind, sense, lancy, feeling, or
memory, aud the taslr oi reduciug them ιο hermouy is left ιο ιιο
reader’s sympathiuiug instinct. It is a power which appears to deul
with language not by violence, bnt by pessumum, not straiuiug or
torturing it ιο bring out the required atteranoe, but yieldiog to it aud,
as it were, following its humours. Isangnage is not yet studied ior ite
own sake: that feature belongs ιο ιιο post-Augustan time oi the
decline oi poetry: bnt it hes risen from subordination into equality,

ι and the step to despotic supremacy is but a short one.

Το enumerate the felicities which are ιο heion in the Eclogues

I have been seneible oi them, 1 have generally endeavoured ιο indicate
them iu the commentary, though 1 fear thet through brevity and other
inulte oi expression I have not always succeeded in conveying the im·

and systematic artis that presented by the fourth Eclogne, ιο ιιο notes
on which 1 would accordingly beg ιο refer the mer. In thie place,
however, it may ιο worth while to illustrate my meaning by a briei
review oi those passages in the Eulogues in which external nature is
represented as in sympathy with the joys aud sors-owe of pastoral life.
The frequent repetition ol the notion may speek ill ior Virgil's capacity
oi invention: the variety with which it is presented, extending not
merely to form, butte colons, is a signal witness ιο ιιο modiiying
power ot his fancy. ιοι us look at the two passages, in some sort
