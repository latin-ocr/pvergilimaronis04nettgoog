prognostica of the westher which occupies the latter port oi Virgil's
FirstBoola The very first words of Aratus' poem, οὔχ optior. evidently
suggested the familiar appeal nonos vides, which Virgil, in imitation of
Lucretius, introduces more thau once in the Georgica. 'Phe whole of
the prognostica that follow, signs oi wind, signs oi rain, signs of fair
westher, signs from sounds by land or by sea, signs from the flight, the
motion, or the cry of birds, signs from the actions of beasts, reptiles,
and insecta, signs from the flames of lampe, and the appearanoes on
water, signs from the sun aod moon at their rising aud at their settiug,
are all given nearly as Aratus has given them, though the manner in
which they are dealt with is Virgil’s own. We know not how closely

‘ Aratus may have followed his original, if indeed hs had en original iu

this as in his other poem3 but however much or however little scientilic
precision may have suffered from his languogo, which is that oia

cluster of phenomena. But Virgil poshes the right of a poet over his
materials far beyond Aratus. He delights in the profusion of pic·
torosque images which is to be found in Aratus' collection of prognos-
tics, and he makes free use of them for his own purposes; but those
purposes are rather poetioal than properly didactio. Ii the reader is
not wear-iad, it matters little that he is left iu ignorance of part of what
it concerned him to know. Any one who will compare the hundred
and fourteeu lines in the Dioeemeia, ou the signs giteu by the moonaud

sarne topic, will see at once that tbe two writers must bave proposed to

In the case of a third writer whom Virgil is supposed to have
imitated, circumstances have been less favourable to os. Quintilian,
iu the well-known chapter in which he reviews the various authors of
Graece aud Rome, asks whether Virgil can be called au uusuccessful
follower of Nicander. But of Nicander's Georgica which is evidently
the work referred to, we possess only fragments; aud these, with the

exception of oue or two of the least important, relate to any part of
the subJ'ect rather than to those of which Virgil hos ohoseu to treat-
