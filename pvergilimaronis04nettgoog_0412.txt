GEORGICON LIB. III. 203

Primus Erichthonius currus et quattuor ausus

Iungere equos, rapidusque rotis insistere victor.

Frena Pelethronii Lapithae gyrosque dedere ¹115
Impositi dorso, atque equitem docuere sub armis
Insultare solo, et gressus glomerare superbos.

Aequus uterque labor3 aeque iuvenemque magistri
