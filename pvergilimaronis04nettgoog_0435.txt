At non, qua Scythiae gentes Maeotiaque unda,
Turbidus et torquens flaventis Hister harenas, 666
Quaque redit medium Rhodope porrecta sub axem.
Illic clausa tenent stabulis armenta, nec ullae

Aut herbae eampo apparent aut arbore frondes;

Sed iacet aggeribus niveis informis et alto

Terra gelu late, septemque adsurgit in ulnas. sss
Semper hiemps, semper spirantes frigora cauri.

Tum sol pallentis haut umquam discutit umbras,

Nec cum invectus equis altum petit aethera, nec cum
Praecipitem Oceani rubro lavit aequore currum.
Concrescunt subitae currenti in flumine crustae, 666
Undaque iam tergo ferratos sustinet orbes,

Puppibus illa prius, patulis nnnc hospita plaustris;
Aeraque dissiliunt volgo, vestesque rigescunt
