are simply pointed ont, it is natural to assign to the ὁμοιότητες of
Octavius Avitum whether this is also the case with the passages in
which Virgil is said to have drawn upon recondite Greek sources is, I
should think, doubtful, nor am I at present able te offer any hypothesis
cn this point.

Turning to the passages where Virgil is defended against hostile
criticism, it is natural to suppose that when his alleged plagiarium
from Homer, or alleged mistakes or want oi management in his narra·
tiva are in question, the ultimate source cf the notes both in Servius
and Macrobius is the work of Asconius contro obtrectatores Vergilii.

It is less easy to conjecture what were the sources of the minute
verbal criticisms cn which we dwelt at length in previous pagas3 bnt
there is considerable presumptiou that some of them at least are as
old as Verrius Flaccus. I have dmwn out the following lists with a
view cf eliciting the points common to Macrobius with Nonius, Festus,
Gellius, Servius, Philargyrins, and the Verona scholia.

Macrobius 6. 4. 2, addito: adfice et per hoc infesta. Hoc iam dixerat
Lucilius in libro XIV. his versibus “Si mihi non praetor siet additus
atque agitet me.'’

Servius A„ 6. 90, additas: est autem verbum Lucilii.

ἓ 3. Vomit aridam: agmen of a river. These notes are only found in
Macrobius.

ᾖ 5. crepitantibus flammis. Macrobius illustrates only hom Lucretius.
Nonius, p. 255, quotes the passage in Virgil in a note on erepere.

ᾖ 6. Ferreus bostis Horret agea Macrobius illustratas from Ennius.
Serv. A. ll. 601: Horret, terribilis est: est antem versus Ennianus
vituperatas a Lucilio dicente per irrisionem, eum debuisse dicere horret
et alget.

Tremulum tornac. Macrobius only.

§ 8. Umbracalam. Macrobius illustratas from Varro and Cicero (de
legibus and Brutus). Servius Ε. 9. 41 (Dan.) has a different quotation
from Cicero, “ umbraculisqne silvestribus.”

ἕξ 9, 10, 11. Transmitto, defluo, discludc. Macrobius only.

§ 12. Deductae. Macrobius says deductam pro tenui et subtili
eleganter positum est, illustrating from Afranius, Cornificius, aud
Pomponius. Schol. Veron. lt. 6. 5, deductam carmen, tenue, graeile,
subtile. Serv. a. deductam . . . . tenne: translatio a lana, qnae
deducitur iu tenuitatem. Nonius, p. 289 (av. dedocere), deductam
dicitur melleet suave: Vergilius Bucolicis . . . . “deductum dicere
carmen.'’ The expression deductam cumaeo is praised by Quintilian
8. 2, as “proprie dictum, id est, quc nihil inveniri possit significantius.”

§ 14. Proiectam. Macrobius illustrabes from Sisenna, and quotes the
subet. proiectas-ds from Lucretius: si secundum veteres, porro iacta
