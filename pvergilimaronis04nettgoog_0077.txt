already pointed. Phe coincidencee between N onius and Quintilian ar
importent, 44 indiceting the existence cf some work or works on thes
doubtful verbs in Quintilien's own time': 141 Quintilian wae not him
4411 4 grammarian, but used the collectione of prolessed scholare whet
he had to touch on technieel points 41 thie kind. And Quintilian ma
well have consulted either Pliny or Probus, or both.

In 414 Prolegomena to Virgil Ribbeck throws out a hint that th
whole 41 444 seventh book 41 N onius may, in hie opinion, be borrowe
11414 Ρ14444. 11441 rather inclined to infer thet it is derived, directl
41 indirectly‚ 11414 two sources. This conclusion ie, I think, warranto
by 444 fact that even in so short a space the 44414 note 4444141 tim<
occurs twice. This ia 444 4444 with pertirct, which ie illustreted 4
p. 472 from Lucilius, and on p. 475 11441 Α1144144; with panio
illustrated on p. 471 11441 Cicero, and on p. 479 with one oi the san
passages in a fuller iorm3 with manducor, pp. 477 end 4793 with eopr
lor, pp. 476 end 479; with miro, pp. 474 and 480, with morino
pp. 471 and 4803 with moderant, pp. 471 end 472; with laeto, pp. 44
eud 472. This phenomenou hes already met ue in the two lists ‹
Priscian, audit seems natural 44 account for it in the 44144 way, vir
by supposing 4444 there were two werke iu which 444 441114 14444 wer
dealt with and illustratori perhaps to e great extent by the sen
exemplos. From 44444 two works the letter grammariane made u
their chaptere on nonna and verbs, without taking the paine to avo:
treating of the 44144 word twice. We know that two ench werke 44
be ascribed 44 Pliny and Probus, and that Priscian drew largely up<
these two authore. The general resemblance between Priscien's chepte
on doubtful verba and 444 seventh book 41 1144144 makes it natural
inier that it wes from Pliny aud Probus 4444 14 wae mainly compiled

The point 41 4414 digression will now at length, I hope, be apparer
