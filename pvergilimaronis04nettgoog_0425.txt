306 Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

In furias ignemque ruunt: amor omnibus idem.
Tempore non elio catulorum oblita leaena aas
Saevior erravit campis, nec lunera volgo

Corpora, si tentum notes odor attulit aures?

Ac neque eos iam irene virum, neque verbera saera,
Non scopuli rupesque cavae etque obiecta retardent
Flumine, correptosque unde torquentia montis.
