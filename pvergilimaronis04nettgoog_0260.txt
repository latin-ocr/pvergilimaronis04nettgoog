altogether nnauthoriaed eeneee3 terme borrowed from the local usage of

the different Greek natione, the Aeoliam, the Aetoliam, the Ambra·
ciane, the Cypriane, tho Doriene, the Peloponnesium, eud the Rhodiane3
terme invented by hie own ingenuity, through the procoee of derivation
or composition. The structure oi the two poeme, eo iar ae I have
examined thern, eceme to be not unliko thet which ie familiar to the
reodere of didactic poetry. Roob commences with a briei eddreee to
the pereon to whom the poem ie inscribed, and a briei statement oi
the subject, in the one caeo a description oi noxioue reptiles, and oi the
caree ior their bitee, iu the other an account of edible and potable
poieone and their remediee; eech coneiete ol a number of paragraphe of
moderate length, apparently bearing a eubetautiul resemblance to oue
another, connected by modee oi transition which ure not quite free
from eumeneee, and occaeiouelly relieved by come mythologicel or
geographical uotico; and each ende witha briei reference to the author,
whom the pereou addreeeed ie requested to bear in mind. In tho
Therieca there are one or two paeeagce which enable ne to compare
Nicander more cloeely with virgil. 'Phe directione in the Third Book
of the Georgice to get rid of eerpente from the cattle-ubeda by iumi-

the poem occure iew liuee on the Chereydroe, which have supplied

hanute the mountain lawne oi Calabria. Every reedcr of the Georgica

water, and the drege at the bottom oi the lake are seen, appear-e that
moment on land, aduet and bloodleee, warming hie grim form in the
