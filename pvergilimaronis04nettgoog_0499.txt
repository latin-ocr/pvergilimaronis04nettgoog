380 P. VERGILI MARON IS

Pulsus amor? quid me caelum sperare iubebas? ert
En etiam hunc ipsum vitae mortalis honorem,

Quem mihi vix frugum et pecudum custodia sollers
Omnia temptanti extuderat, te matre, relinque.

Quin age, et ipsa manu felices erue silvas,

Fer stabulis inimicum ignem atque interfice messis, 330
Ure sata, et validam in vitis molire bipennem,

Tanta meae si te ceperunt taedia laudis,

At mater sonitum thalamo sub fluminis alti
