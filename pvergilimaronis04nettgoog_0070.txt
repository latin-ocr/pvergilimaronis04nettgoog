Aen. 5. 93). In 11. 6. 76 he defended the word necasse against the
objections of Cornutus (Serv. ad. 1, comp. Gell. 2. 6 = Macrob. 6. 7. 4)1

1110 sixth chspter of Gellius' second book 10 taken from the commen·
tary of Probus. 00 A. 9. 373 he defended “sublustri noctis in umbra ”
by the example 01 Horace’s ‘⁴ 00010 sublustri '¹ (Schol. Veronensis), a
parallel which Servius borrows without acknowledgmeut.

Not that Probus was blindly purtial to his author. “ Probo displicet
1010111 sudus? say Servius and the Verona scholis 00 Α. 2.173; he
would have preferred the omission 01 11410 “puppibus et laeti
nautae inposuere coronas ''; 01 the story about Camilla in A. 11. 554
he said that it wss ἀπίθανον πλάσμα, un incredible fiction. Gellius, 9. 9.

Of Δ 9. 369 (“ equites ex urbe 101101 Ibant, et regi Turno respousa

linsris (thetis, probably, Probus as quoted by Sulpicius Apollinaris)
complained 11111111 was inconsistent with 7. 600, “saepsit se tectis
rerumque reliquit hebenus.”

Such are some of the scanty relics of 000 of the most important
commentarios, perhaps the most importent commeutsry on Virgil that
antiquity produced. 01 the existiug commentar-y which 110010 the

should expect from the 0000001 31100 01 Probus by Suetonius (Ill.

of grummur and criticism that he devoted his attention. The re-
