VIRGIL AND HIS adumar GRITIGS. li

21, it is ramarked: “Ecce pontifex tuus apud quae aras mactetur
ignoret, cum vel aedituis haec nota sint et veterum non tacuerit
iudustria.'’ The attach is replied to; aud both attack and reply are
abridged by Servius on Aen. 3. 21 as follows: ‘⁶ contra rationem Iovi
taurum sacrificat. . . ubique enim Iovi iuvencum legimus immola·
tum . . . adeo ut binc putetur subsecutum esse prodigium.”

Macrobius 3. 11. 1: miti dilue Baccho: ia marum laeti libant. The
attack and reply are given in a shorter form iu Servius on G. 1. 344
and Aen. 8. 279 (Dan), ‘⁴ quaeritur eane cur in mensam et non in aram
libaverint‚’' duc. But Servius has not the remarks on mitis and on
mulsum iu §5 9 aud 10.

3.12. 1 ε Aen. 8. 285: on this alleged omnim erroroi Virgil Servius
(Dan.) hae a note in substance much the same as that of Macrobius “

3.12.10: Aen. 4. 57: Virgil is said “toto caelo errasse cum Dido
sua rem divinem pro nuptiis laceret Luciferae Owari, dac. Et quasi
expergefactus adiecit Iunoni unte mnaes,” dc.

Serv. A. 4. 57(Dau.): “Alii dicunt hos deos quos commemoravit nuptiis
esse contrarios, Cereremque propter raptum filiae nuptias execratum,
dc. dc. Male ergo invocat hos Dido, quaesibi nuptiae optat Aeneae‚'’
doc. The note is very long and full, but Isuspect that Macrobius, a frag·
ment onlyof whose comment remeius, has more ci the original wording.

Compare aleo Macrobius 1. 15. 10, with Servius ou Aen. 8. 6543 .
Macrob. 1. lta with Serv. on Aen l. 8.

The result of the foregoiug comparisons between Servius and
Macrobius is this: that in the great majority of cases where Servius
and Macrobius have identical notes, those of Macrobius are iar the
fuller, clearer¹ aud more logica13that in the collectione cf parallel
passages from Homer Macrobius has some which Servius has not,
Servius many more which Macrobius has not, and there are many
in common. Hence the natural inference is not (as Ribbeck thinks)
that Macrobius was using a fuller form cf the actual commentary oi
Servius thau that which we now possess, but that both Macrobius
aud Servius were drawing upon older ⁴commentarios and criticisms.

Is it possible to say with any degree of certainty to whom thess
wurks or any oi them can be assigned?

Taking the hostile criticisms in Macrobius aud Servius first,
with the exception of those which can with certainty be assigned to
Cornutus aud Hyginus (see pp. lix.-lxi.)‚ Ι would observa that there
are a number of precisely the same character and often worded iu the
same vigorone end acrimonious style; I mean those which deal chiefly
with minute points of logio or narrative and less often with points oi

expression. Such are (l) the uufavourable remarks upon the order oi
the narrative iu the Aeneid (p. xxxv. foll.); (2) those iu which Virgil is
