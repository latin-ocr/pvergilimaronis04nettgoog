218 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Principio arboribus varia est natura creandis.

Namque alise, nullis hominnm cogentibus, ipsae 10
Sponte sua veniunt camposque et flumina late

(lurra tenent, ut molle siler, lentaeque genistae,
Populus et glauca canentia fronde salicte3

Pars autem posito surgunt de semine, ut altae
Castaneas, nemorumque Iovi quae maxima frondet 15
Aesculus, atque habitae Grais oracula quercus.

Pullulat ab radice aliis densissima silva,

Ut cerasis ulmisque; etiam Parnasia laurus

Parva sub ingenti matris se subicit umbra
