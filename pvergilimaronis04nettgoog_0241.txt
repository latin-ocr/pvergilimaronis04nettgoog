124 ΟΝ THE LATER

in his mother's arms-an allusion, Haupt thinks, to the early ioreneio
efforts oi Nero—that civil war shall be bound in chains, the senate no
longerbe sent to the block, and civic honours uo more be a mockerya-
in confirmation oi which blissiul prediction he points to the meteor, then
shining, not with a bloody glare, but in a clear sky. The brothers
receive the intimation with becoming awe, and resolve to record the
verses, in the hope that Meliboeus-perhaps Seneca, perhaps, ae Haupt
thinks more probable, G. Calpurnius Piso-may convey them to the ears
of Augustus. TheMSS. give this Eulogue the somewhat inappropriate
title Delos, which may have arisen, as Wernedori suggests, from an
association in'the transcriber’s mind between the prophetie island and
propbecy ot any sort.

The second Eulogne is called Orocate, from a maiden with whom
Astacus, a gortimer, and Idas, a shepherd, are in love, aud whom they
accordingly celebrate in amoebean etraius, with their respective produce
as the stakee‚ Thyrsis as the umpire‚ and Faunus aud the Satyrs, the
Dryade and Naiads, “ sicco Dryades pede, Naides udo‚’' and all nature,
animate aud inanimate, ae the audieuce. They appeal to their patron
gods, talk oi their respective occupatione, vie with each other in offers
to any deity who will bring the absent Crocale, enumerate their wealth,
boast ot their personal attractione, and finally are each reminded that
it is time to go horne. Thyrsis pronouncee them equal in the following

worda· “Eete pares, etobhoo concordssvivite: namvos

Et decor, st cantus, et amor sociavit, et aetas.”

The third Eulogua, entitled anrotio, is pronounced by Scaliger to
be “ merum rus, idque inficetum : '’ and certainly, though its coarseness
. may be paralleled from Theocritus, it ie not what we should have ex-
pected from an imitator of Virgil. Iolas, on asking another shepherd,
Lycidas, after a stray heitar, finds that he can think of nothing but
Phyllis, who has deserted him. Lycidas had discovered her under a
tres, singing with his rival Mopsus, and inflicted personat chastieement
on her: on which she had run off to her friend Alcippe, declaring that
she would live with Mopsus for the future. The forsakeu lover now
wishes for her back on any terme, and bethinke himself of sending her
a poetical entreaty, which Iolae good-naturedly offers to convey. Itis
accordingly recited by Lycidas, and taken down by Ioles on cherry-
barlr-a piteous composition, describing the lover's desolate condition,
reminding Phyllis of her past pleasure in his society, comparing hie
persona} attractione and hie wealth with those of Mopsus, offering to
lether bindhis vindictive hands—hands which nevertheleee had given
her many presentsv-sneering at Mopsns’ poverty, and finally threaten·
