LIFE OF VIRGIL.

'l'ur fullest aud most authentia life of Virgil now existing is that pre·
lixed 10 the commentarios 01 Aelius and Tiberius Donatus. This
memoir, which was formerly attributed to Ti. Donatus, is dow by the
almost universal consent of scholare assigned to Suetonius.¹ There is
also a Life prefixed to the commentary which bears the name 01 Probus,
which may also be ultimately based upon Suetonius, but whose author,
whoever he was aud whatever authorities be followed, cannot be
scquitted of either ignorance or carelessness.¹ And a short memoir is
also prefixed to the commentery 01 Servius, which, although it is for
the most part merely a confused abridgment 01 the work 01 Suetonius,
contains some additional matter, notably the statement that the lines
about Helen in the second Aeneid (vv. 566 1011.) were Virgil‘s own,
and were struck out of his manuscript by Varius aud Tucca.

The mernoir by Suetonius, in the form in which we now possess it,
does not perhaps contain all that Suetonius wrote about Virgil, bot so
far as it extends its value is all-important. For Suetonius, a diligent
and conscientious collector 01 10010, had access to documenta contem·
poraueous with the poet himself,³ including his correspondence with
Augustus, and memoirs oi him by the poet Varius and other friends.
Fragments only 01 these original authorities hare come down to us,

(⁶⁶ Ancient laires 01 Vergil.,'' Olareudou Preas, 1879). 1 should have added to those
already adduced the fact that daroma, iu bis additions to the Eusebiau chronicle,
which in this part are unirersally achuowledged 10 0000 from Suetonius, uses lan·
guage about Virgil identieal with that 01 the Life attributed to Donatus-A. abr.
