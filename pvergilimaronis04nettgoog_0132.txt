INTRODUOTION. ,13

the most part as uudramatie es the thoughts which that lenguage ex·
presses are couventicnal aud nnreal. In a very iew instances he attempta
to produce nn appearance oi rusticityby an archaism, a proverb, a con-
versationel ellipse, a clumsy circumlocution⁴3 even there, however, he
seems to he copying Theocritus, rather than following the nature which
he had seen arouud him, and the strain iu which his shepherds usually
converse is scarcely less elaborate than the ordinary diction of the Geor-
gice or the Aeneid. So iu the practice oi the Greek poete the bucolic
hexameter had e structure oi its cwn‘: ee handled by virgil itdces not
differ from the diductio or the epie. Yet a more poetieal people than
the Romans might be pardoned ii they iorgot their senso oi dramatic
propriety in the delight with which they weloomed such specimeus oi

langnage aud versification as those which the Eulogues every where
exhibit. une tedicus labour oi the file, the absence of which is deplored
by Horaoe⁸ as intel to the excellence oi Roman poetry, had ct last

⁸ See Gebauers ‘De Poetarum Graecorum Bucolicorum, imprimis Theocriti, Car·
minibus in Eulogis e Vergilio adumbratis, Libri Duo' (Leipsio, 1861), pp. 8 rell, a
valuable monograph, ol which I believe only the flrst volume hee yet appeared.

There is e passage iu Wycherley's recommendatory lines ou Pope's Pastorals
which ie worth quoting, not only ior its own ingenuity, but as expressiug the view
taken by Pcpe aud his friends oi the lunguage in which pastoral poetry should be
written-a view probably not very unlilre Virgil'c own, mumtis mutandis.

“Like come loir shepherdess, the silvan hince
Should wear those flowere her native flelds produce,
And the true memure ci the shepherd's wit
should, like his gerb, be ior the country iit:

Yet must his pure aud uuaffected thought

hiere nicely than the common swain’s be wrought:
So with becoming art the player's dress

Iu silke the shephcrd eud the shepherdaes,

Yet still nuchaugod the form und mode romain,
Shsped like the hemely russet of the swain.”

See also Pcpe’s discouree ou Pastoral Poetry, prefixed to his Pastorels, where he
lays down praetiosi rulas ior bucolic writing, and his ironica! comparisou oi hie own
Pastoruls with Philips' (Guardism No. 40), where the doctrine that ehepherds ought
todeni in proverbe is not iorgotten.

⁵ See Gebauer, pp. 70 roll, where too much ls perhaps made ot the instanoee-
uct ruore thau 24⁰ lines out oi the whole number-in which the bucolic caesura is
preserved. Itis evideut that Virgil set uo stcre by it whatever ae a necessary law
oi composition : that he should have employed it in the Eologues more frequently
thau iu the other two poema. is no more than is normal in a young writer just
beginning to icrm his versification, und at the time familiar with the eadeuoe oi
Theocritus. Gebauer, however, has done good service in pointing out throughout
his work instances in which virgil, without distinotly imitating Theocritus, has
taken s hiut from him in lunguage or versification. Such inquiries are spt to seem
tedicusly minute: but the'y munet be ssiely overlooked by any one who would
really appreciate the ert oi such a writer cs virgil.
