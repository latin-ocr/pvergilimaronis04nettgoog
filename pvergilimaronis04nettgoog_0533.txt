414 ON THE LATER

Felicisque vocat teneant quae membra catenes.
nt postquam 1001110 causam cognovit ab ipsa,
Deetinat in thalamos per bellum vadere ponti,
Altera ei Gorgo veniat, non territus ire.”

But I must redeem my promise 01 anelyaing au entire portion oi the
poem, the first book.

Manilius proposes his subject, characterizing it very brieflyas “ divinas
artie et conscia fati Sidera* diversos hominum variantia casus‚” and
recommending it ae a new etrain, which is to shake the woods 01 Heli·
con. With equal brevity, Caesar, the worthy heir of a world which
the gode gave to his father, is ackuowledged as the poet’s inspiring
deity. When the universe ie at peace, the secrete 011110 universe may
be most fitly uuiolded. The poet kindlee lire on two altars, aud 10011 1
twoiold beat, the 11011 01 song and the heat 01 hie subject, which is no
1011 than the world itseli. Who first revealed such divine secrete to
rnen? Who but the gode? It was Mercury who first diecloeed the
wondroue movemente oi the stare: Nature assisted iu the work 01
malting herself known, and taught Egyptian and Assyriae kinge 10
scrutinize that heaven which their power so nearly reached. The next
etep wae made by the priests, who, long familiar with divine things, were
allowed to perceive the influencc 01 the 11111 on human life. Kucw·
ledge was reduced to a system: occult lawe were discovered, and the
universe was seen to be regulated by eternal reason. Till then 111 was
uncertainty: men wept 10 find· stare vanish‚ and wera rajoiced at their
reappearance. 'l'hoee were, indeed, days ci darkness, when earth was
untilled, mines unworked, the sea annavigated, and every oue thought
hie stock 01 knowledge enough. Time, penury, aud experiance worked
the cure, and taught lauguage, agriculture, commarca, and the arte 01
war and peace ; nay (10 paee 110111 more hackneyed topice), taught divi-
nation, magio, and necromancy, and did not stop till they had mounted
up 10 heaven and etudied nature's operatione, the caueae 01 1111111101,
conflagratione, eurthquakes‚ rain and wind, and the reason why winter
ancwie 101101 than summer heil; till the fiery bolt had been wreetcd
110111 Jove and transferred 10 the clouds. Hence came the knowledge
01 the stare, the poet’e present subject, which he hopes to be permitted
to pureue through the gentle decline 01 1 long life.

Firet he undertakes to describe the appearance 01 the universe,
glaucing‚ ae he 1111101,111101111011111001111 01 ite origin, chaotic or
11011111,1ῙιιΙο111111 or Neptunian‚ a problem which he seems 10 think
beyond diviua no lese than human comprehension. The upper part 01
tha mundane system is fire, next comcs air, which serves as it were to
fan the fleme: thirdly water, which in like manner leede the air by its
exhalatione: lastly earth, which occupies 11 once the lowest place and
the centre, the other clemente falling off from it in equal proportione on
