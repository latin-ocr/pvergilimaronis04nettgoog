each other, end dealing with precisely the same subject, and to a eon-
siderable extent using the same instances. The first of these begins l,
p. 378, beginning at the words “et erbis quaedam eadem voce utrumqne
significant, id est 'actionem et passionem.” After giving one or two
instances of such verbs, and a few of ordinary deponente, Priscian pro·
ceeds, “ex his multa antiqui tam activa qnam passiva significatione
protulisse inveniuntur,'' and then gives a list which is on the whole
alphabetical from tha latter a to o: ansitior, adminiculor, anynror, ad-
hortor, apiscor, abominor, consequor, amplector, adorior, abutor, admiror,
anterior, aggredior, aspernor, architector, assertor, argumentor, reor, vereor,
solor, arbitror, blandior, comotor, conspicor, comminiscor, complector,
calumnior, cornifiaor, despicor, demolior, dominor, depccnlor, detarqior,
ementior, scordior, asperior, frustror, hortor, sor, meditor, obliviscor, and
then metor and adulor. Instances from classical authors are then
quoted of the following verbs: auxilior, adulor, adminiculor, adhortor,
nnanor, opisoor, abominor, consequor, amplector, complector, adorior,
obator, admiror, testor, anteetor, exsecror, machinor, polticeor, adgredior,
aspernor, architector, adscctor, argumentor, arbitror, blandior, consolor,
conspicor, comminiscor, consequor, contestor, consector, complector, calam
nior, carnificor, dignor, detestor, doepicor‚ demolior, creditor, dominor.
depecntor, detarqior, ementior, eaordioa asperior, frnatror, hortor, sor
obliviscor, nector, tutor, vador, venor, oethicor, coafferor, veneror.

It is to be observed that the list in which the words are illustratet
by exemplos, although it purports to be identical with the uuillustratei
list, is not entirely so. 'Phe lists with exemplos is fuller and als<
more strictly alphabetical than the other: adulor, for instance, oceun
in its place among verbs beginning with a. The three words reor, vereor
and solor, which interrupt the alphabetioal order in the first list, recu&
in the second, bnt without any instaures. The impression left ou m)
mind after reading the two lists is, that the author of the first had copie«
from the author of the second, bnt not quite accurately in respecto
the arrangement. In other words, that Priscian is making extract
from two manuale, both of which depend on a common source.

After some further remarks on the confusion of voices, in which ot
p. 391 the beginning of a fresh alphabetical list is quoted from Cape
(adiutor-delapidor)‚ Priscian, on p. 392, starts the subject again wit
another long list which is in tha main alphabetical: testo, opino, conch
convivo, contemplo, carnoto, commoro, anxilio, angara, anapioo, connotent
crimino, motio, digno, eaecro, epoto, circlo, tacto, tnotito, tonario, laet
laetifico, misereo. These words are giren without any instances: an
then follow some more which are‘illustreted from classical authors
horto, largio, canapo, alterco, medico, ampleno, amplecto, complecto. (
these neeges, Priscian adds, examples may be found in Pliny (that i
