LIFE OF VIRGIL. xxvii

Before leaving Italy Virgil had tried in vain to extract a promise
from Varius that ii anything should huppen to him, he would burn the
Aeneid. On hia deathbed he constautly selred for his manuscript to
burn it; hut this request being also refused he leit his writings in his
will to Varius aud Tucca, with the proviso that they were to publish
nothing which had not been already given to the world. With the

sanction oi Augustus, il not at his instance, Virgil's lest wish was
judieiously disregarded, and the Aeneid was published by Varius and
Tucca, with such corrections only as were absolutely necessary, even
the uufiuished verses being leit as they stood.⁸

Virgil is said to have been tall, durh, and oi a rustic appearance.
His health was indifferent, for he suffered irem weakness iu the throut
aud stomach, as well as from headaches aud spittiug of blood. Little
is known oi his character, but what is known ia (with doubtful excep·
tiens) iu his iavour. His owu language about his poema iu the Ilclogues
leads us to imagine him fastidiens, modest, and sensitiva, and this ap·
parently was the general impressiou. The modesty oi hisloolss procurad
him at Naples the punning niclrnameoi Parthenias. He objected very
much to the demonstratione made inhia honour ii ever he appeared in
the streete oi Rome, au event, if we may believe Suetonius, oi very
rare occurrence.⁹ Virgil's father must, if we may trust the little poem
in the Cataleptoa addressed to the villa oi Siron,¹ have been alive at
the time oi the confiscatione oi 41 nc. He was blind at the time of
his death.² Virgil had two brothers, Silo and Flaccus. Silo died inhia
boyhood3 Flaccus, who died in riper years, is said hy Suetonius to
have been the Daphnis of the fiith liclogne.⁸

Virgil’s mother, Magia, survived her husband aud married again. A
son, named Valerius Proculus, was the issue oi this union.

Virgil seems to have been much heloved by his friends, among whom
