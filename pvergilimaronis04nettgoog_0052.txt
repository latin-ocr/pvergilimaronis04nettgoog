VIRGIL AND HIS ANOIENT CRITIOS. xlix

Georg. 3. 391, munerario niceo laurae. Not Servius but Philargyrius
bas this comment in a shorter form: “huius opinionis auctor est
Nicander: nec poterat csse nisi Graecus.”

'Phe conclusion which Ι draw from this comparison is again that
Servius‚¹ Philargyrine aad Macrobius ara drawing upon the same
source. And that this source was one work, not several, is, I think,
rendered probable by the uniformity of style which characterizata the
whole oi these notes as given in their fuller form by Macrobius. add
Macrob. 1. 3. 10 on torquet maltos acu umida cereas (Aen. 5. 738).

Ι now come to a number of remarks in the third book oi the Satur·
salia, in which Virgil’s knowledge oi religione antiquitiesis discusaed.
Aa before, I shall compare Macrobius and Servius on each note.

abridged ia Servius on Aen. 4. 635.

3. 2. 6: coti reus: “ vox pmpria sacrorum est,'' bc. So Servius.

3. 2. 7: Acn. 4. 219: arcun manibus apprehendere, ora and asc.
Much cithia note is in Servius (Dan.) on Aen. 4. 219 aud 6. 124.

’3. 2. 1οε cilulcrl; laetam paeana: Aen. 6:657: Servius is silent.

3. 215: facium vitula: Eol. 3. 77 : Servius in a note independent oi
Macrobius says, “ nt faciem twre, socium cqcu.’'

3. 2. 17: Aen. 1. 373, et uacet nucales nostrorum assilire laborum
Aeneas pontifex: Servius (Dan.) has the same note, but in e fuller
form.

3. 3. 2ε sacrum, eoactum, profanum: Servius (Dan.) hasthe gistof this
note on Aen. 12. 779.

3. 33: religiosus, religio: Servius (Dan.) bas the same note, but
without mentioning Festus, on Georg. 1. 269.

3. s.1f011.: delubrum: Seruius (Dan.) on Aen. 4. 56 bas the same
quotation from Varro, and on 2. 225 he quotes another note from

3. 5. 4: litare: so Seruius on Aen. 2. 119 (Dan.)

¹ Or rather his ancient interpolator. 1 do not however think it necessary to sup·
pose that this writer is borrowing directly from Macrobius, as in other places be
either ignores him or is quite independenter him. (See neta on p. lvi below.)
