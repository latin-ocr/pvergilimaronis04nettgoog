There is something almost unexampled in the state of feeling which
at Rome, and in the Augustan age iu particular, allowed palpable and
avowed imitation to claim the honours oi poetioal originality. Pacuvius
and Accius are praised not lor having called out the tragedy which lies,
patent rather thau latent, in Roman history and Roman life, nor even
ior having made the legende which they derived from Graece the sub
ject of original dramas oi their own, but specifically for having applied⁸
their wit to tho writings oi the Greeks, as to so much raw material, and
adapted to the Roman stage the entertainments which had alternately
deligbted eud terrified the populace oi Athens. Horace invites atten-
tion to himseli,⁹ as an independent traveller along untrodden ground,
not as having discovered any measure peculiar to the Latin language,
any melody to which the thoughts oi his countrymen would naturally
vibrate, but as having been the first to display to Latium the capabili-
ties oi the Archilochian lambio, the Alcaic, and the Sapphic. So Pro-
pertius¹ spe'aks ¹ol Thyrsis and Daphnis, and the rustic presente which
shepherd makes to shepherdess, names aud things copied precisely from
Theocritus, as if they were actually a new world to which Virgil had
⁴ introduced him and his contemporaries oi the great city. Striking as
the phenomenon is, the circumstances of the case enable us readily to
account ior it. The Roman knew only oi a single instance oi a national
literature iu the world: it challenged his allegiance with au undisputed
claim, aud his only course seemed to he to conform to it, and endeavour
so far as he could, to reproduce it among his own people. It seems as
ii no parallel to such a mental condition could exist in our larger
modern experience‚ where the very number of the models set before ns

correcte our admiration hy distracting it, and forces ue, as it were, in
