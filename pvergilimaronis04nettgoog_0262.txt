INTRODUOTION. 145

forming may still study with wonder aud delighl. of these the last,
and perhaps the matest, hae yet to be noticed. I allude of course to
Lucretius.

The poem anthe Nature of Things could hardly be overlooked in
speaking ol the Georgica, even if there were no evowed connexion be·
tween the later work aud the earlier. Not only is it the single instance
of a latin didactio poem produced by any predecessor of Virgil whose
works hare come down to ns, bnt itis the only didactio poem of extant
antiqnity which can he put into comparison with the Georgica for
largenees ol scope and elaboratiou of structure. The Works and Days,
as 1 have said, has few of the characteristica oi systematio poetry:
the poems of Aratus aud Nicander embrace each a limited subject,
which they handle nearly as it might he handled in a prose treatise.
But it is the glory of Imcretins' poem, as itis the glory of the Georgica,
that it is founded on a theme which iu composa and variety is worthy
to he the material of a great work of art, aud thet it considers that
theme witha reference, more or lese distinct and unverying, to its
capabdity of affectiug the imagination. The one teaches the laws
which goram the universe of nature, that man may oense to quail bolore
an unknown power3 the other teaches the appliances by which man
may subdue the earth, and live in enjoymeut of the simple blessings
which nature confers: but both profess to go as deep as liie itself‚ and
both seek to impress the mind not only with principles of truth, bnt
with images of beauty. But our interest iu the parallel increases
when wc perceive that there is something in it more than mere coinci-
dence. Itis a singular thing that virgil never mentions by name any
of those whom he sets himself to imitate. Eveu iu the Ecloguee,
where he talks ol Pollio and Gallus, oi Varios aud Cinna—ray, of
Bavius and Maevius, he never names Theocritus, Bion, or Moschus,
though we hear of the Siciliae Muses, the verse of Syracuse, and the
shepherd of Sicily. In the Georgius he does not name Hesiod other-
wise thau hy glaucing at the song of Ascra and the Aonian⁴ mount,
while ol Nicander and Aratus there is no hiut whatever. 'l'he whole
cl the Aeneid pasees without the slightest reference lo Homer, though
we have occasionally a glimpse oi Virgil's own personality, and iu one
passage⁵ a distinct mention of Greek legende as they are treated in
Greek tragedy. Thus it need excite no surprise that Lueretius is
nowhere named in the Georgica, or even indicated by any epithet or
circumlocutory expression. But there is one remarkable passage

which speaks as plainly to any reader of the De Rerum Natura, aa
if virgil had talked ol Lucretius with the same directuess with which
