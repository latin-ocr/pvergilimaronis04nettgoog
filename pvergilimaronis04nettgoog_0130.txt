INTRODUOTION. 11

themselves in bucolic colours, instead of copying the actual bucolic life
which they ssw or might have scen in the country. They started from
the position that shepherds‚ besides being subjecte for poetry, were
themselves singers end lovers of song3 it was not difficnlt to convert
the proposition, and assume theta pastoral singer might be spoken ot
as a shcpherd. A symptom of this failing appears even in Theocritus,
in whose seventh Idyl the speaker, dcecribing himself as being in com-
psny with a poeticsl goatherd, modestly declines a comparison with the
professed pocta Asclepiades and Philetas, therehy intimating that he is .
himself a profeseed poet in disgnise.⁸ Iu Moechus the identification is
mors consciouslyrealiced.1 Bion is bewailed as the ideal herdsman, for
whom Apollo and the mod-gods wept, whose straius drew looks of love
from Galatea, and whose pipe even the lips of Pan may scarcely touch.
These, however, who wish to see to what extent it may be interwoven
with the texture of a serias oi poema, should look fovit in the Eulognes.
They will not have very far to seolr; indeed it meets thern at the very
threshold. Nothing bnt the extreme awkwardness of the manner in
which it ia introduced into the first Ecloguc could have prevented the
critice from recognizing it at once. As it is, they have passed it over
in their search for something more recondito and more creditahle to
Virgil. Their view, as elaborated hythe latest commentators¹is that
Tityrus is a supposed farm-slave, perhaps a beiliff of Virgil’s, who, going
to Rome to purchase hie fresdom, receives the welcome assurauce that
his master’e property is to be undisturbed in the general nnsettlcment;
the obvious truth is (I am stating not my own discovery but that of my
former coadjutor) that the notious of the enfranchised slave and the
poet secured in his ferm, the symbol and the thing symbolized, are
actually blended together, so that the narrative isat one time allegorical,
at uuother historical, Tityrus going with his earuings to his master, aud
receiving for answer, “ Yon shall not be diapossessed by my soldiers.”

The same couventionel conception reappears in other places, though it .

is nowhere else so clumsily managed Menalcas, the poet-shepherd ol
the ninth Eclogue, whose stmius were so nearly lost to the world,is
admitted cn all hands to be Virgil himself. In the opening oi the sixtli,

Virgil is once more the shepherd Tityrus, who is taught by Apollo that

a shepherd's duty is to make his sheep iat and his verses thiu. li Virgil
