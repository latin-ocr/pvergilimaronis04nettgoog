cii ΤΗΕ AN OIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

written hastily and with many omissione, It was the work ct his old
age, and he therefore hastened to finish it, intending to make good its
shortcomings in afutura work. This was ιο include hhtories of the

Virgilian heroes, accounts of the rivers, mountains, countries and
towns mentioned in the Aeneid, and remarks on other points ot
antiquities οι· el general interest. Itis very important to observa that
these notes were to be taken trem ancient commentarios. Itis possible
that the young Donatianus was content with the first instalment of his
father's learning3 bnt modern scholare will lael inclined, in their own
interest, to regnet that Donatus did not begin with his extracta from
the older commentatore. For these, it would seem, he never lived to
complete.

IUNIUS PHILARGYRIUS.

The fragment of a commentary on the Eulogues, bearing the title
Philargyrii deplanatione, is preserved in three manuscripts (Lauren-
tianns, plut. XLV. cod. 14, lOth century; Parisinus 7‚960,10sh century3
Parisinus 11,308, oi the same date). And an incompleta commentary
on the Georgius, of excellent quality, but with large gaps, which gives
the impression of the work es we have it being a series oi extracts,
has been since the time oi Ursinus assigned likewise ιο Iunius

Philargyrius. M. Thomas, in his essay upon Servius (p. 277), observes
that the name of Philargyrius is not, in a single MS, prefixed to these
scholia. This fact would of course,if taken by itself, be sufficient to
throw grave doubt upon our right to assign the notes to Philargyrius.
But it must also be observed that the Berne scholia, of which more
anon, often quote from a Iunilius Flayrus, whom scholare usually
identify with the Iunius Philargyrius ot the commentary on the
Eclognes. And the notes ot Iunilius Flagrus very often* coincide

est dehinc me non esse deserturum in te studium patris, ut tibi quantum potuero
pari praeparem cara quae propter supra dictam causam videor omisisse. Sicorim
flet ut origines singularum personarum, quas Vergilius Aeneidos libris comprehendit,
atquae in aliquo studio floruerunt, †aut nullius fuerint meriti vel contraria deligendo†
depressae siut. Simul etiam cognosces oppidorum insularumque'rationem,regiouum,
montium, camporum vel fluminum, templorum aa fanorum, herbarum quin etiam et
lignorum vocabula, et cetera his similia. Sed haec sio accipias velim, ut ex eom·
mortariis scias veterum me esse collecturum antiqua enim et fabulosa et longiu-
quitatis causa incognita nisi priscorum docente memoria non potuerant explicari.”
(From the end ot the commentary. Iqaote iram the edition oi virgil by Fabricius
of Ghemnitz, Bassi, 1547.)

¹ 1 have observed tbe following instanoes of mnespondenee between the notes
attributed to Iunilius Flagrat iu the Barna scholia, and those found on the same
passages in the commentary bearing the name ot lunias Philargyrius:

uel. 1. 2ος Georg. 1. 58, 292-3, 295; 2 160: 3. 5, 113, 280, 392, 408,461(r)
