ECLOGA X.

GALLUS.

Ir the claime of friendship were but scantily schnowledged in the sixth and eighth
Eelogues, they are abundantly sutielied in the present. which ie entirely devoted to
Gallus. Like Varus, O. Cornelius Gallus is said by Servius cn Eclogne 6-1s‚ lo have
been Virgil's early mociate and follow-student nuder Siron. Hc is said by the same
authority to heve bcen appointed by the triumvirs to collect money from those treus·
Padane towns whose laude were tc be spared; end it isoonjectnred thst he may have
been the Cornelius who, ecmrding tc Serv, attached Alfenus Varus in a speech for
his division of Mantnan territory us nnfcir to the inhabitants-one or both cf which
munds would be sufficient tc account for Virgii's connexion with him, even if the
story of their previous intimacy should be deemel untrustworthy. Besidee, he hed
been already admitted to Pollio’s friendehip‚ und so might eesily win the regurd of
Pollic'a protege His further life need not be noticed herc: cll we have tc dc with
is the fact thal, as this Eologue shows at the time of its composition, he hed becrm

known esa poet and a lover, having written elegies (four books, Serv. says), chiefly ·

addressed to his mistress Lycoris, like Propertins' to Cynthia, and Tibullns' to Delie,
besides translatiug (if thet is to be considered with Serv. a separate workl some of
the poems of Euphorion (note on v. 50). Lycoris i identified by Serv. wilh Volumnia
Cytheris, a freedaornan of Volumnius Eutrapelus, and et one titire mistress of M.
Antonine, whom the alme account erroneouely represents as the rival mentioned v.
23. These elegies are repeatedlymentioned by Osid. who appeareto have regarded
them with high admiration, aud once, in an obscure passage (3. 26. 91, 92) by Pro·
portius: bnt only one fragment of them survives, preserved by Vibius Seqnestsr, De
Fluminibus. . 333.

Here, ss id E. l, the identification of the ehepherd and poci is so rudeiy managed
as to amount to absolute confusion. The subject of the Eclogue is the hopeless and
absorbing passion of Gallus: Gallus, if not a posterni poet himself, is the friend cf a
pastorsl poet, and so one of the pastoral companyr accordingly he ie represented ss
being st one and the same moment a soldier and a shepherd, sarving in the camp in
ltnly, and lying under a roclr in Arcadis with need-gods to comfort him. Aa before,
the nshed simplicity cf the explanation hes caused it to be missed: Gallus hus been
supposed to have gone on furlough into Arcndin, while others, who could not reconoile
the langusge of v'. 44 with his being in Arcadia st eli, have changed the text.

The structure of the poemia taken from the letter partof Theocr. Idyi 1. the dying
Daphnis supplying the model for Gallus, whose despoir however does not bring him
to death. virgil is supposed mosmale the story in a song ss he ie tendinghis geals,
and in rising to go home for the evening he gmceluliy intimates thet he is clocing the
volume of pastoral poetry.

The time is commonly thought [though Ribbeck would date the poem earlier] to
be flxed by vv. 23, 4ο· full, and by general consideratione regurding the date of the
Eclcgues, to the end of 716 or the beginning of 717, when Agrippa vves leading an
expedition into Gaul and across the tibine, with which Gcilus’ rival ie snppomd to
have gone, while Gallus himself was engaged in some other service. perhaps in Italy

under Octavimus, acting against Sex. Pompeius. Vv. 20, 23. 47 seem to point tc
winter or early spring.
