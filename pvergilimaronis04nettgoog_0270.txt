INTRODUGTION. 153 ¹

The soil is rich (in the supposed case), requiring and repayiug work ι
the bullocks are ιο be strong: the very line in which they are mentioned
labeum with the intensity ol their exertior, which is to begin with tho
year itself and ιο be repeated in the summer: and when the olods have
thus been a second time turned up and exposed to the sky, the sun is
to perform its part in the great confederacy oi toil, darting its meridien
bearm upon them, end baking them thoroughly till they ornmble into
dost. Having delivered his precepto ior plonghing‚ fallowing, stubble-
hurning, harrowing, crossplonghing, irrigating, and dreining, he re-
flecte again on the arduousness ol a sarmer's dutiae, and proceeds
again to lay a mythological foundation for their support. Following
what is apparently a differentis notan inconsistent line of legend,
he refers the origin of labonr not to Deucalion’s time, but to the
coming in of the silver age under Jupiter. In Saturn’s days mankind
hed one common stook, and earth yielded every thing iraely: Jove
was the first to break up tha laud by human skill‚ using care to eharpen
men’s wite, nor letting the realm which he bad made his own grow
dnll under the weight of lethargy. Thon came the divers erts of life:
so Toil conquered the world, relentless Toil, and Want that grinde in
adversity. The acorns had begnn ιο fail in the secred lorests end
Dodona to withhold her sustenance, when Ceres taught meu to plough
and sow. Soon the corn itself had hardship and sickness laid upon it:
those plagnes came in which gave the iarmer no respite, and, ii he
relaxes his vigilance, drive him back into a barbarism which resembles
the golden age only in what it is without. ‘¹ Unless your ruke is ever
ready to exterminate weeds, your shout to scere away birds, your hook
to resti-ain the shade which dau-kens the land, and your prayers to cell
down rain, poor man, yon will geza on your neighbour'e big heap of
grain with uuevailing envy, betake yourself to the woods again, and
shake the oak to allay your hunger.” The sameindomitehle enthusiasm
animatos the poet, when, with the Second Book, a fresh divisiones his
subject opens upon him. In a second invocation he sees himself and
Bacchus as follow-labourers, taking part iu every detail of the vintage.
“Come hither, Father of the winepress! strip off thy bachius, hare
thy legs, aud plunge them with me in the new must.'’ He snrveys
his new province in all its length aud breedth3 and the result is a
fresh access ol exulting eucrgy. “ Come then, husbandmen, and leern
the culture proper ιο each according ιο its kind, and so mellow your
wild truite by cultivation, nor let the ground lie idle. What joy to
plant Ismarus all over with the progeuy of the wine-god, and clotho
the mighty sides of Taburnus with a garment of olives! ‘’ No jot oi
the difficulty is abated or omitted: the objects of labour ara mountains,
which themselves suggest· the notion of au arduous undertaking: but
