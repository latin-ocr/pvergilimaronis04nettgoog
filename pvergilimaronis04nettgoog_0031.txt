xxviii LIFh} OF VIRGIL.

perhaps the most intimate were Horace, Quintilius Varus, Varius, an(
'theca⁴ Horace describes⁶ Virgil and Varius, whom he comtantlj
mentions together, as most transparent and lovable scula.

Owing to the generosity oi his friends Virgil enjoyed a fortune o
nearly AEIOQOOO. It is interesting to lmow that when Augusto
offered him the property oi an exiled citizen, whose name has no
been preserved, ho could not bring himself to accept it. He wo
seldom at Rome, though he had a house there near the gardense
Maecenas, and spent most oi his time in Sicily or Campania.⁰

He was a very bad speaker‚⁷ and failed completely when in his carl
life he attempted the professiones advocate. But hia reading was s
beautiful thet⁸ J nlius Montanus, a contemporary poet, said that rere«
which in themselves seemed lifelese and trivial sounded well when l
recited them.

Hali oi hie property he leit to his hali-brother Valerius Proculus,
quarter to Augustus, atwelith part to Maecenas, and the rest to Varii
and Tucca. His remeius were taken to Naples and buried in a ton
on the road to Puteoli, with the epitaph-
