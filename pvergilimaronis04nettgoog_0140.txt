'ln historioel groundworh ol this Eelogue is the essignment ol lende in Itoly hythe
triumvirs to their reterens, in 713 nno. Tho “Spoliotion,” seys Mr.hlerirole (History
oi the Romen llmpire, rol. ιιι p. 222), “ spread from the snbnrbon lende ιο remote
traete, irem monleipol ιο private possessione. Eren loynlty ιο the (leesorien porty
proved oi no orell: the faithful Mentno shored the lete oi its neighbom, the dis-
etleeted cremona end the little township of Andos‚Virgil's birthpleee, in the llan-
tuen territory, wee involved in the eelomities ol its metropolis.'’ 'Phe story, es drown
ont from Suetonius' Liie end the scettered notices in Serrins’ commentam, ιο thot
l'irgil trent ιο Rome on the seirore oi his property, end obtained from Oetevienus e
deoree ol restitution, whioh however wes resisted end neerly rendered ineiseotoel by
the wiolenoe oi the new oeeupent, referred ιο ιο the ninth Ilologue so thot o second
oppenl ior preteetion hed to be mede. Thot the poet's inheritenoe wss twioethreot-
ened seems erident from Eelogue 9, ww. 7 loll, while we know from the present
Eologue thet on one ooeeeion he received en essursnoe ol protectior from Octowisnns
himself, ond it mey be inferred from other perages thet Alienus Vnnrs, thelegotes
in the Cisalpine niter the bottle of Perusia, if nothis predeeeseor O. Asinius Pollio,
interiered on Virgil’e behnlf. These iente egres sufficiently well with the troditionel
noeonnt, et the seme time thet they do not enohle os ιο decide on oll its details,
even os eenhined in the obbrevieted summery just given [See however, the llx-
eureos on the ninth Elelogueell. N.] .

The speakers in the Eelogue oro two shepherds, one oi whomis enjoying rustie
lile, singing ol his lore ond seeing hie osttle seed ondieturbed, when heiseneountered
by the other, who hes been expelled lrom his homesteed end is driving his goots be·
lore him, with no prospect but ο eheerless exile. 'Ihis ιο simple enough, but it ιο
eompliooted by en unhsppy ertiflee. 'Phe fortunate shepherd is represented es e serm
slere who hes just worked out his freedom: end this emeneipotion is nsed to sym-
bolize the eonflrmetion oi the poet in his property. 'lhe two events, with their eon·
eomitante, ore treeted οο eonvertible with eeeh other, the story being told portly in
the one form, pnrtly in the other. See vv. 41 foll. end notes. This eontnsien erises

lrons the identilloetion oi the shepherd end the poet, spoken of in the Introdnotion
