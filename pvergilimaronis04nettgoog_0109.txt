ovi THE ANGIENT oouuuurlrosss ΟΝ VIRGIL.

almost deservo tho name of classioal, ior it is clear that in the main it
is constructed out of very ancient materiale. For his information on
points oi history and antiquities Servius drawa, very likely atsecond
or third hand, on Oato, Varro, Nigidius, and other authors of the samo
stamp: for mythology on Hyginus, for grammar and philology on
Varro and Verrius Flaccus. The riews of these writers he probably
learned from the scholare of the eud oi the first and beginning ol the
second centuries, as Asper and Probus, and the writers oi the time oi
Trajan, Hadrian, aud the Antoninos. He quotes, indeed, writers oi
the third and fourth centurias, as Sammonicus Serenus, J uba, Solinus,
Terentianus Maurus, Statius Tullianus, Titianus, and Catulinus3 but
since the age of the Antonines, if we may judge by the original
remarks of eo celebrated a scholar aa Aelius Donatus (see on p. c),
little if anythiug that was both new and true had boen added to
latin scholarship. ’

Of 'l'itiauns and Catulinus a word or two must be said before we

leave this part of our subject. On Aen. 10. 18 Servius mentions these
writers as the authors of a treatise which might in modern phraseology
be entitled ‘¹ Virgil as a Rhetorician'’: “Titianus et Catulinus, qui
themata omnia de Vergilio elicuerunt ad dicendi usum.’‘ A fact most
important as illustrating the decline both oi soholarship and educatiou.

The curriculum oi educationis becoming more and more limited to
tha study of Virgil; the study oi Virgil is becoming more and more
scholastic and technical. Are there any actual remains of these base
and degenerata efforts oi analysis? 'l'he fourth book ol Macrobius
is au excellent specimen oi what this method could effect. A mere
fragment of the book remeius, in which a thousand and one instances
are given of Virgil’s command over the resouroes of potitos. I hare
uotioed a greeet many similar remarks in the commentary oi Servius, of
which the following may be taken as specimens:

A. t. 31, et suasoria est omni parte plena: nam et purgat obiecta et
ostendit utilitatem et a timore persuadet Et usus est apto causae
principio, nam etcum aliquid propter nos petimus, benevolum nobis
eum qui audit facere debemus, dcc. ’

A. 4. 361, oratorie ibi finivit ubi vis argumenti constitit.

A. 6. 104, sane sciendum adlocutionem huno esse suasoriam cum
partibus suis.

A. 7. 535, rhetorice viles trudit in medium3 nobiles vero primo et
ultimo commemorat loco.

A. 8. 127, et est rhetorica persuasio, nam principium ex utriusque
persona sumpsit.

A. 8. 374, sane hoc rhetorica suasio est, nam principatum a verecundia
sumpsit.
