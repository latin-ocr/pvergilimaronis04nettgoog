134 GEORGIOA.

he regarded as necessary to the conduct of life in an agricultural com-
munity. But after prose writiug had come to be studied, didacticpoetry
of this kind was no longer possible. It might linger on among the
uneducated: but among the cultivators of composition as an art, those
who wished reallyto instruct were sure to write in prose. Theophrastus
took the place of Hesiod by the same law which gave the chair of
. Xenophanes and Empedocles to Plato and Aristotle. The Hesiodic
form however remained after its spirit had passed elsewhere. The
union of practical teaching with the charms of versification continued
to be attempted by writers who forgot to ask themselves under what
circumstances that anion had first been realized. It was easy to pro·
duce something more systematic than the Works and Days, while the
discovery of images appropriate to rural life, yet not unsuited to the
dignity of the Mure, furnished a sufficient employment to the poet’s
fancy. The poetical grammarians of Alexandria were naturally at·
treated to a species of composition which, though perhaps incompatrble
with a spirit of profound criticism, has peculiar points of affinityto the
temper of a critical age: and the Alexandrianizing poets of Rome were
not unwilling to follow the example. The Phaenomena of Aratus found
at least two distinguished translatore: Lucretius and Manilius gave the “
form and eolour ol poetry to the truths of science, Virgil and Horace
to the rules of art ; and the rear is brought up by such poets as Gratius,
Nemesianus, and Serenus Sammonicus. In the so·called Augustan age
of English literature the same causes were seen to produce the same
effecte. We had Essays on Satire, Essays on Uunatnral Flights in
Poetry, Easays on Translated Verso, Essays on Criticism, Essays on
Mans Arta of Preserving Health‚ Arte of Dancing‚ and even Arts of
Oookery: the Chase, and the llleece, and tho Sugar-cane. Some of
these the world has forgotten: others are still read with pleasure, not
however for the precepta contained in them, but for the terse language
aud polished verse in which those precepta are enforced. But whatever
may be their beauties, the Hesiodic spirit is absent from one and all
alike. If we are resolved to track it to its lurking-places in English
poetry, we must ascend to times more nearly resembling Hesiod's own,
when old 'lusser could write, not for critice, but for fermers, and the
Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry were received as respectable .

Colonel Mure rightly remarks⁶ that the Works and Days might be
more correctly described as a Letter of Remonstrance and Advice to a
Brother. It is round the grasping‚ lazy, improvident Perses, μέγα νήπιε
