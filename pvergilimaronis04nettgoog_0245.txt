128' ΟΝ THE LATER ·

Quae, lieet interdum contexto uimine clausa,
Cum parvae petuere fores, cen libera ferri
Norit. et agrestis inter volitare volucres,

Scit rursus romeam domum, tectumque subire
viminis, et oeream totis praeponere silvis.''

It is noticeable that the two songs, which ere continuone, are of exactly
the same length, like those in Virgil's fifth and eighth Eclognes.

In the third Eclogue Nemesianus hes imitated Virgil’s sixth. Three
shepberds lind Pen esleep, take his pipe‚ and veiuly try to perform on
it: he carabes, end immediately offers to play, taking for his subject
the praises oi Bacchus, whose name the copyist has accordingly pre-
fixed to the Eclogue. The song, which is oi no great length, being
given in the ‘oratio recte‚’ not, like Virgil’s, thrown into the form of
a rapid snmmmy, speaks cf the birth and infency ci the god, and of
the productiones the grape, the first treuding of which is described.
There is considerable picturesque power in various parts of the song,
which admits, us Wernsdori remarks, of illustration from various
extant gems. Here is e picture oi the child in the arms of Silenus.

‘⁴ Quin et Silenus parvum veneratus alumnum
Aut gremio foret, eut resupinus sustinet ulnis,
Et vocet ad risum digito, motuque quietem
Adlicit, cut tremulis quaerut crepitacula palmis:
(tridens adridens horrentis pectore setes
Vellieat, aut digitis auris estringit acutas,
Applauditve meuu mutilum ceput unt breve mentum,
Et simus tenero collidit pollice neres!

Evening ende the Ilclogne, which Fontenelle rather boldly proncunees
to be superior in elegence cf invention to its Virgilian prototype. It
indifficult to see the appropriuteness of the praiscs of Bacchus iu the
mouth of Pan, though they might heve come with some grece from
Silenus3 while the pictoriel features, being such as are found repre-
sented in works of art, may perhaps be due us much tc artistic tradition
as to the imagination of the poet.

The fourth Eclogue, Eros, is again amoebean‚ Mopsus end Iaycidus
singing cf their loves, Meroe and Ioles. The strophes ure short, five
lines each, and each hes the same burden, ‘cantet emat qubd quisque:
levant et carmina curas! 'Phe topice are, as usual, chiefly Theocritean
and Virgilian, the transitoriness of beanty, the universality of passionate
pursuit, the lover singing in the heat when all else is sheltered, end
the employment cf the rericus resources oi megic. As iu the eighth
Eclogue oi Virgil, there is no formul conclusion.

Such are the eomewhat meugre products yielded by Roman bucolic
poetry after Virgil’s time-compositione es unreel es Virgil's own, with-
