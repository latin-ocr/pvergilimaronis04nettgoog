THE LATER DIDAOTIG POETS OF ROME.

Havnvc spoken of the Latin Pastoral writers who came aiter Virgil‚l
may naturallybeexpectedtosay something oi his successorsinDidaetic
Poetry. It is true that the two cases are not precisely parallel: in
the one not only the kind of poctry, but the subject, was thesaurus
Virgil's own: in the other the similarity merely affecte the torm, and
does not extend to the matter. Like virgil, Calpurnius and Neme-
sianus saugoi the contestu, the loves, the laments oi shepherds: unlike
Virgil, Manilius, Gratius, Nemesianus, and Serenus Sammonicus, sing
of astronomy aud astrology, oi the chase, and oi the cure oi dames.
Here, however, as in the Introductory Essay to the Georgius, I au
addressing those who, like myseli‚ are students ci Roman pcetry, not
studente of Roman agriculture, so that 1 shall need no apology ior
devoting a short time to the examinatiou ci writers whose work!
resemble the Georgius, as the Georgius themselves resemble not ua
treatises of (lato aud Varro, but the poems oi Lucretius. These writer
ef course will be themselves considered simply with reference tc thei
‘iorm ε to discuss their matter is a task which is fortunately beyond mg
purpose, as itis certainly beyond my ability.

The most considerable Latin Didactic poem subsequent te th
Georgius is unquestionably the Αείνοοοοοίοα1 ci Manilius. It i
divided into five books, consisting respectively oi 926, 970, 682, eu
aud 745 lines, so that its length is nearly double that of Virgil's worl
Its damis still an uusolved problem. N o allusion to it occurs in au

ancient writers: it is not even quoted by asingle grammarian: iudee
there is no traca oi its existence till the eleventh century, which all
happens tc be the probabis date oi its earliest MS.; while, on the oth
hand, its own iuternal evidence, as estimated by the most compete

Similsr mistakes were made by early English writers, who tslked about Virg
