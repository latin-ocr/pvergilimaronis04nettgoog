138 GEORGIOA.

of life, his direction about which occupy more than fifty lines, thaeum
of the whole being 0 cantion to avoid ill repert. “ Ill report is slight
load to take up, but a heavy one to 00111,Ι aud a hard one to shake oli:
for no report dies altogether which has been reported of many people:
for it has something of the god in it.” The lest series of precepta is
about the lucky and unlucky days of the mouth, which are enumerated
with 0 iuluess contrasting strangely with Virgil's brief notice of the
subject. “Differeut men,’' concludes the old bard, “praise different
days, but few have any knowledge: sometimes a day is a stepmother,
sometimes a mother: wherefore blessed aud happy is hc that has know·
ledge of all, aud works his work unblamed by the immortale, distinguish-
ing omens, and avoiding occasions to transgress.''

ss I bave thought it worth while to give this eketch of Hesiod’s poem,
, endeavouriug to preserve something of its colour as well es its form,
that it may be seen how far removed it stands in its rude simplicity
from the pomp and circumstance of later didactio poetry‚ and bow little
Virgil understood of bis author’s genius or bis own when be spoke of
himself as singing the song of Ascra through the towns of Rome. 'Phe
Iliad and Odyssey, if modern triticiam will allow us to eujoy them in
their iutegrity, might easily be shownto possess most of those requisites
which the writer of the Aeneid and the grammarians whom he not im·
probably followed doubtless considered the invariable elemeuts of an
apic poem: but even though the Works and Days should be judged to
have successfully resisted the solvent power of German analysis, its
relation as a whole to the Georgius must still be regarded as one of
contrast rather than cf similarity. But where a poet avows himself an
imitator, traces of imitation are not likely to be wanting in his work:
and though Virgil has not followed Hesiod as closely 01 00 constantly
as he has followed Theocritus 01 Homer, the instances of resemblance
between them in points of detail are neither few nor equivocal. Eveu
the pervading philosophy, if sc it may be called, of the Works aud
Days‚ the philosophy of labour, reappears, with nc perceptible lose of
reality, as the animatiug soul of the Georgica, though the plain direct-
ness with which itis enforced in the oue affords a significant coutrast
to the artful dexterity with which it is insinuated in the other. 'Phe
picture of the Pive Ages doubtless suggested Virgil’s lines 011 the
transition from the reign of Saturn to the reign of J ore, which iu their
turn supplied some hints to Ovid when he set himself to reprodnce the
Hesiodic narrative 01 the opening of his Metamorphoses. The story of
Prometheus has no counterpart iu Virgil‚ except so far as it may have
taught him thatun episode may fumish au agreeable relief iu didactic
poetry‚ and so have given rise to the narratives which conclude his
third and fourth books; bulthe moral of thc story, the duty of sub·
