. THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. cix

version of Philargyrius says “ut poetae Graeci fabulantur,’' the Berne
scholia naming Alcman as the Greek poet. Here Servius again has
quite a different note. Sempronius Asellio is cited by the Berne scholis
alone on G. 3. 474, (laelius Antipater on G. 2. 197 (where Philargyrius'

noto is lost iu our version), Asper on G. 4. 238, Nigidius Figulus on

· G. 1. 174, 428, 498 (in all of which passages, again, the notes of

Philargyrius are lost), G. 2108, and Suetonius 011 G. 4. 564. For
other instances where the Berne scholia have notes of velue I must
referto the commentary, where 1 have quoted from them whenever
they offered anything worth preserving.

Resders who hare had the patience to follow this essay thus far will
bo prepared for the conclusion at which Ι am inclined to arrivs, that a
large body of Virgilian learning hsd accumulated hythe end of tho
fourthcentury su, the greater snd by fur the most vnluable part oi
which was at least as old ss the age oi Trajan, and much eren older;
and thet from these materials it wes that the author or authors of the
Verona scholia, Philargyrius, Macrobius, Servius, and the authorities
followed by tho Berne scholia, drew their information independently of
each other. This hypothesis will I hope be found to account for tho
considerable number of instanccs in which they agree, and the number,
perhaps hardly less considerable, in which they exhibit independence
or dirergence.
