found an artist who would submitto it without complainiug. Tho
finished excellence of his worlrmanship is a fact which will not be resdily
impeaohed or overlooked, though ite importunos may easily he under
rated. We are apt, perhaps, not sufficiently to consider what isin·
volved inthe style or diction ol poetry· We distinguish eharply between
tho general conception and the language, as if the power which strikea
ont the oue were something quite different irom the slrill which elabo-
ratos the other. N o doubt there is a differenoe between the two opera·
tione, and one which must place a poet like Virgil at a disadvantage as
compared with the writers whom ho followed 3 bnt it would bo a mistake
to suppose that imagination may not he shown in the words which
embody a thought as well as in the thought which they embody. 'l'o
express a thought in langnage is in truth to express alarger conception
ιγ ιιο help oi a number of smaller ones; and the same poetical ιοοοιιγ
’ which originales ιιο one may well be employed iu producing the other.
It is not merely that the adaptation of the 'words to the thought itself
requires a poet's sense, though this ie muoh; bnt that the words them·
selves are images, each possessiug, or capable of possessing, a beauty oi
ite own, which used not be impeired, bnt may bs illustrated and set off,
by its relative position, as contributing ιο ιιο development of another
aud more· complex besuty. Itis not necessary that these words, in
order to he poetical, should be pictoresque in the strict sense ol the
term; ou the contrary, it may suit the poet'e object to make a physioal
image retire into the shade, not advance into prominent light: but the
imagination will still be appealed to, whatever may be the avenne oi
approach—by ιιο effect of perspectiva, by artful juxtaposition, ιγ
musical sound, or perhaps, ae we have already seen, by remote intel·
lectual association. The central thought may be horrowed or unreal,
yet the subordinate conceptione may be true aud beautiful, whether tho
subordination be that of a paragraph to an entire poem, a sentence to a
paragraph, or a phrase or word to a sentence It is,I conceive, to a per·
ceptiou ol this fact, and not to a defereuce to any popular or mechauioal
notiou oi composition, that ths praise ot style and execution in poetry
is to be referred. Poetry is defined by (loleridgel to be the best words
in their right places; and though at the first statement his view may
appear disappointing and inadequate, it will perhaps be ‘found that
further consideration will go lar towards justilying its truth.

Il the Augustau age is, as it is allowed to be hy common consent,
the epooh ol the perlection of art aa applied to Iatin poetry, that
perfectiou is ceutrad in Virgil and Horace. Ovid, tho third great
representative poet of his time, sufficieutly indicates that even then a
