‘292 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Corripuere ruuntque effusi carcere currus,v

Corda pavor pulsans? illi instant verbere torto

Et proni dant lora; volat vi fervidus axis3 '

Iamque humiles, iamque elati sublime videntur

Adra per vacuum ferri, atque adsurgere in auras;

N ec mora, nec requies3 at fulvae nimbus harenae uo
Tollitur; umescunt spumis flatuque sequentum:
Tantus amor laudum, tantae est victoria curae.
