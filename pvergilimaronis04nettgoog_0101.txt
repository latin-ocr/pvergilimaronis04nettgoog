xcviii THE ANGIHNT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

extent thau now appears by Nouius, in whose writiugs, as we hare
0000, a great deal of lexicographical work ia embedded.

The nume oi Terentius Scaurus, the author oi a Latin grammar and
a controversial treatise against Caesellius Vindex, as well es of com·
mentaries on Plautus aud Virgil, brings us into the reign of Hadrian.
Gellius calls him (11. 15. 3) “divi Hadriani temporibus grammaticus
vel nobilissimus.” His grammatical works are cited by Gellius aud
the later grammarians: oi his commentary ou Virgil so little is expressly
quoted that it would be rash 10 prononnce any judgment upon its
merita. ln A. 3. 484, ‘⁶ nec cadit honori,'' Servius tells ns that Scaurus
read “honora'’ The Verona scholia quote a note of his on Crete A.
146, and another on 5. 95, iu which a theory is advocated that snakes
are born from the marrow of men: a notiou which also appears in
Servius' note on the passage.

The Carthaginien Sulpicius Apollinaris, the master oi Aulus Gellius
aa well as of the unfortunate emperor Pertinax, paid considerable
attention 1ο Virgil. A note of his on “ Silvine Albanum nomen, tua
postuma proles,'’ (bc, in which he controverted the opinion ci Caesel·
lius Vindex, is mentioned by Gellius 2. 16. 8. Gellius, 7. 16. 12, says
that he took “praepetes aves’' as equivaleut to Homer's οἰωνοί
τανυπτέρνγεςε and 16. 5. afoll. quotes his opinion on the prefix oe iu
vemens, 000000, vestibulum. As iar 00 cacus is concerned, Sulpicius
seems merely to have quoted the opinion oi Verrius Flaccus (see
above p. lix), as indeed he 0100 did in the 0000 oi the word portamur
(comp. Festus, p. 238).

POLLIO.

A scholar oi this name with the 000000 Asinius is mentioued by Ser·
vius on Aen. 2. 7 and elsewhere several times. The remarks attributed
1ο him are foolish and hardly worth quoting. On the passage just
alluded 10, ior instaurabo seems 1ο have observed that “ duri miles
Ulixi” was meant for Achaemenides. Itis possible, oi course, that
the celebrated Asinius Pollio may have criticised Virgil, but that such
notes can have come from him, or from any scholar oi the Augustan
age, is almost incredible, and I am therefore inclined to agree with
Ribbeck (Prol. p. 116) thatif the Pollio of Servius is 1ο be identified
with any known person, he was probably the scholar mentioued twice
by Marcus Aurelius (Fronto, pp. 42, 63, Nabar) as an excellent com-
mentator on Horace.

IULIUS HATERIANUS.

Haterianus is mentioned as 0 commentator on Virgil by Macrobius
(3. 8. 2), and several times iu the Verona scholia. He is assumed by
