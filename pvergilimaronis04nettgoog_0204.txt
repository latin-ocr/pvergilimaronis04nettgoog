PHARIIACEUTRIA.
namon mennemonus.

We have here again the songs of two shepherds, Damon, in the character of a despair·
ing lower lamenting oser his faitbless Nysa, who has islren a less worthy mate, and
finally resolving on seli-destruction, and Alphesiboeus, in the character of a woman
nlso foraalren by her lover, though only for a time, and tryIng to recover him by en·
chantments‚ which at last prove successful.

[Serv. says that this poem isaddressed to Angustus, though he mentions comman-
tetcrs who took it as referring to Pollio. The reference ιο Angustus cnn only be
defended by an unnatural iinot impossible interpretatlou of v. 10. It is much more
probable that the piece is eddressed ιο] Pollio, ln s prefece running parallel wlth
that to E. 6 (οοο Introduction there, aud note on w. 'l here). Its dete may be flxed
from ww. 6 foll, which apparently point to the time when Pollio bad gained bis
victory owen the Parthini in Illyricum (‘ victricis laurus,r v. 13, refutiug the hypo-
thesis thst it was addressed ιο him when setting out cn the expedition). and was on
his way homa to receive the triumph which he celebrated Oct. 25, s.u. 71⁵. Whethsr
“iussis carmina coepte tuis,” v. ll, actually mesas that Pollio suggested one or both
of the san'eots of the Eelogna, or merely that he asked ιο have another pastoral
written, is cf course impossible ιο say. Voss chooses to fancy that it was for the
second song. ss an imitation of the Pharmaceutda of Tbeocrhus, that Pollio hed
'ested and that Vlrgil intends to give it the preference, both by ibe appeel to the
Musa, ww. 62, 63, and by the title of the whole poem. But Vtrgil'e own words need
ccnsey maneb notion(see note there), and there seems no reason ιο suppose thst
the title Phsrmaoentrla was afflxed by the poet, especially as the Med. IIS. has a
different title, “Damonis et Alphesiboei Certatiu”
