LIFE OF VIRGIL. xxiii

ninth) to Varus, and one (the tenth) to Gallus, who is also mentioned
in terma of the greatest affection in the sixtb.

The acquaintance ot Horace with Vis-gil must have began before
the publication of the Hologues. It was either in the year 40 or
38 οι· 37 (the year when the last Hologue was probably composed),
that Virgil‚ with Varius and Tucca, the future editors ot his Aeneid,
joined Horace at Sinuessa on ajonrney to Brundisium.l Horace speaks
ol Virgil as at that time one ot his most intimate friends, asif their
acquaintance were now ot long standing. The only relic, as iar us I
arn aware, ol the early period oi this friendship is the twelfth ode of
Horaca's fourth book, which, in spite ot the fact that this book was
publishcd after Virgil’s death, it seems reasonable to reler to him.
The ode, which Horace perhaps had not carad to publish before, is
addreesed te a Vergilius whom Horace aslrs to dinner on condition of
his bringing with him a box oi nard in exchange iorHerace’s wine.
The language of the poem would rery well suit the time when both
poeta were young and Horace poor, and before his introduction by
Virgil, the iuuenum nobilium elicies, to the circle ot Maecenas.

Horuce’s judgmeut of the Hclogues⁸ is well known: “melle atque
facetum (epos) Vergilio adnuerunt gaudentes rure Camenae,'’ the
Muses have granted him tenderness and refined wit in his hexameter
writing. The literary sympathy aud intimate friendship between
Horace and Virgil was ol immense impos-tanco aa affecting the history
of Roman literature. It was they who, while enjoining a closer study
of the Greek masterpieces in their length and breadth than had
hitherto been given to them, formed the classical style of Roman poetry‚
and shewed how close imitation oi great models was compatible
with a free aud noble manner, nntainted by pedantry or servility. I
hare endeavoured elsewhere⁹ te collect some ot the passages which
resemble each ether in the earlier werlrs of these twin poeta, thus

&testing l(lin all probability) a constant and intimate communication
tweent em.

The Hologues, says Suetoniua,² were so popular that they were often
recited in the theatra. The same was the case with some ot the poenm·
ef Ovio. On one occasion, it we may believe 'I'acitua² the whole
audienco rose on hearing some ot Virgil's verses, and testified their
homage to the poet, who happened to be present.

When Virgil began the Georgica there is no positiva evidence to ¹
determino. They were undertaken partly in honour of Maecenas,⁸ as
