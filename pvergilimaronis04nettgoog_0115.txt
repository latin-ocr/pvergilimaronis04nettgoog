cxii THE TEXT OF VIRGIL.

between these two recensione is often difficolt, and sometimes (1 think)
impossible.

In the case of Latin manuscripts written prior to the Renaissance,
there is not necessarily any magio in age, exceptio so far as the oldest
copies may on the whole bc trusted to preserve a better orthography.
In other respecta the manuscripts of Virgil are (as we have scen) not
by any means free from gross blunders. But the concurrent testimony,
on the one hand, of several fifth century manuscripts, and, on the
other, of the recension or recensione used by good grammarians and
commentatore, hae combined to preserve the text of Virgil from serious
corruption. In most cases of doubt we have a choice between two or
more readings, either cr any ot which might fairly be adopted without
violation oi grammar, sense, or taste; end thus tho margin left lor
conjectured emendation is comparatively narrcw.

Whether much matter ot value is to be obtained from the countless
manuscripts oi Virgil written from the time oi the Carolingian revival
to the Renaissance, is very doubtful. The Gudian (ninth century),
standing es it does in close relation to the Palatius, is useful where
the latter lails ns; and one oi the Berne manuscripts (Ribbeck’s c)
seems to stand in a similar relation to the Marones. But, so far as Ι
have been able to observo, by far the greater number of valuable

readings given by the cursive manuscripts arc either tc be found in
the uncials and the notes ol the ancient commentator-s and gramma·
riaus, or are such as might easily have been restored, if necessary, by
conjecture.
