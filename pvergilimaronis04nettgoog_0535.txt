⁸ oi antiqnity is comprised inasinglo pentameterof Ovid (Ex Pontat. 16.

34), occurring at the end oi a list oi contemporary poets; a tect which
may help us to reconcile the absolute silence of antiquity about Manilius
with tho intrinsic probability that the Astronomico belong to a time not
much later thau the Augustan age. all that we know oi the history oi
the poet is confined to his name, which appears ιο have been a pet-name
given ιο slaves, thus suggesting the supposition that he was one oi the
class of highly educated slaves, not uucommon in Roman familias, aud
that the practioal knowledge of his subject¹ which his poem displays had
been gained in the course of his ordinary duties. The cognomen ‘¹‘ Falis-
cus,'’ which is sometimes added to his name, rests on the authority oia
MS. which perhaps never existed,⁶ and of a line in the poem itseli.⁶
The exunt evidence for the text oi the Oyoageticc is a single ι18.,ἱ
which is evidently imperfect, though perhaps not to any grem degree,
aud iu parts os evidently corrupt. A corrupt or imperfect text, how·
ever, will not account forthe harshnesses and obscurities with which the
poemia disfigured. These must iu the main be imputed to the writer,
who, having noue but common thoughts to express, isnevertheless not
content ιο express them iu common language.

'rte poem consiste oi o single book oi tao lines. Its opening is not
unpromising. The subject is proposed modestly enough, “ the gire ct
heaven, the arte that bring the huntsman success,” and Diauais invoked
as the natural patroness of the subject, the goddess who, with the other
silvan powers, caure ιο the help of primeval men in his uuequal struggle
with the brutos, and taught him ιο remsdy by art the deiecta of his
natural condition. The poet theu proceeds st ones to describe the cou-
struotion ot a net, and to speak oi the best localities ior getting the
materiale. Thau follows a digression which reads like a pisce oi tho

⁴ In taking leave of Manilius, Iwill venture to suggest an emendation ol his text.
The passage is iu Book 1, v. 245, “Nos in nocte sumus, somnosque in membra
locamus.'’ Scaliger reads “somuo sic,'’ Stibor ‘¹ somno qui.” I should prefer
“vocamus” The words ore confused Luor. 5. 12, where ‘⁶ r·ocorit” ol the MSS.
has been corrected by the editors into ‘⁶ locarit.’'

⁵ Vouched for by Barth, whose testimony however ia doubted.
⁸ V. 40, ‘⁴ At contra uostrisinbellialiua Faliscis.” ‘⁶ Nostris ’' nroy he meant to corr·
trastbyauticipatiou with Spain and Egypt, mentioued iu the following lines, in which

case it need only mean ‘Italian : ' but it seems at least as likely that itis intended
to discriminate Falerii from Cumae aud Etruria, which have just beau spoken of.

eutica ” mentioned below.
