pastoral poetry, ii by pastoral poetry is meant a truthtnl dramatis
representation ci one of the simplest forms oi life. How far it vitictes
the character of the Elclognes as pure poetry, irrespective ci the class
tc which they profess to belong, is a further question, aud one which
ought not to be decided till we have seen how much it may involve.
Ii the Eclogues are to be condemned on this ground, itis hard to see
how we are to excuse a work like Cymbeline. If the somewhat broad
shield oi the romantic drama is sufficient to cover the latter, rcom may
perhaps be found auderit for the former. No incongruity oi which
Virgil has been guilty can be so glaring or so fatal to those notione oi
reality which the very form oi historical knowledge suggests as that
produced by the juxtapositiou oi the modern Italian, not only with the
legendary Briton, bnt with the Roman cf the earlier empire. Itis not
that the lawe of time and circumstance are simply violated, but that
they are violated in such a wey that the result sppears tc nsincon·
ceivsble cs well as false, two types, belonging to different periods oi
the same oetion, and se such forming the subjecte oi an obvious
historical contrest, being imagined ior the moment to coexist, notin
the other world, as in the various Dialogues oi the Dead, where this
incongruity enters into the very idea of the composition, but in a world
which, if not our own, resembles it in all its essential features as s
theatra for human action and passion Yet criticism seems now to bc
agreed that the very glaringness oi such incongruities‚ though doubt-
lese attributable as much tc ignorance or recklessness as to any
prcionnd design, ought only to teach us to divest ourselves oi all
extranecns prepossessions, and examine the piace as a representation oi
human nature apart from the conditions oi time, just as when we look
eteocle oi the early paintings our sense of heanty need nothe nlti-
mately disturbed by cnr consciousneas that the actions portreyed in
the two parte oi the pictura are obviously not simultaneons bntsuc-
ceesive. Vir-gil, oi course, according to our ordinary nomenclatore,
is a classicsl, not s romentic poet, hut the fact will hardly be held to
exclude him irem the benedt oi a similar ples, ii indeed it should not
suggest fresh matter ior consideration with regard to the lsws
generally, aud probably with justice, supposed to distinguish the two
great schools oi Accient and Modern Art.

This, however, is not the only kind oi confusion hy which the pastoral
reality oi the Euloguee is disturbed or destroyed. Not only is the
Sicilian mixed up with the Italian, but the shepherd is mixed up with
the poet. The danger wee one to have been apprehended from the first.
So soon as pastoral poetrycame to he recognized as a distinct species, the
meu oi letters who cultivated it, perhaps themselves grammariens or
professionsl critice, were likely to yield to the temptetion of pointing
