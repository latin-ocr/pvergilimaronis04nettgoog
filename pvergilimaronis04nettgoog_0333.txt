LIBER SECUNDUS.

’-

Tua main subject ottho &cond Book is the culture oi trees, especially oi the vine.
But there is no great regularity in tha mode oi treatment Virgil opens withan
enumerationes the different ways ot propagating trees, natural and artilidal, soas to
give some notion oi the magnitude of the theme: then shows how art can improve
upon nature, and recurs again tothc manisoldness oi his snb'ject, dwelling especially
on the innumerable varicties ot vinea without much relevancy he talks oi tho trees
which are indigenous ιο different countries, and is thence drawn oti into an eulogy oi
Italy, which he does not tit with any practical application. The question oi the

aptitudea ot various soils is uestcd far more widely than the subject oi the book re·
quires, embraoingthe choiceoi corn and pastura land as well as of ground ior planting
vines and other trees. For the next 160 lines the poet seems ιο be thinking exolu-
sively oi the vinc or ot the treesplanted in the ‘ arbustum’ aa its supporters. Hedoes
not distinguieh between the different modes ot reering the vine, but in general appears
ιο assume that the ‘arbustum ' will be the means adopted. He speaks oi the vineaud
its supportem almost indifferently‚as objecta more or less oi the aameoulture, so that
while keepiug the tormer prominently before him he teels himself at liberty to use
general language‚or even toconfine his language to the latter, as metrioal convenience
or poetical variety may suggest; a manner ol speaking which rendere this part ot the
book peculiarly difficultat least to an unprot'essional commentator. The olive, which
was put iorward prominently in the programma ot the book, is actually disposed ot*
in a very few linea, as requiring hardly any culture nt ull, while the other fruit-trees
are dismissed even more briefly. The remaining trees receive a very hasty recom-
mendation to tho cultivam, baclred however with an ussurance that they are even
more useiul ιο man than the vine. In tha celebrated digression which concludes the
book the laborious aspect ot a country lite, elsewhere se prominent, is studiously
kept out ot sight, and we hear only ot ease, enjoyment, and plenty. Ite interest as
bearing on the testes of the poet himself has been noticed iu the general introduction
ιο the Georgica.

'rho beauties of this book have always been admired, and deservedly so. 'l'heyare
most conspicuous in the digressions; but the more strictly diductio part contains
innumeruble felicities of expression, though it may be doubted whether in general
they do not obscure the pmctical meaning as much ae they illustrate it-whether in
fact they do not constitute the strongeet condemnation oi that school oi poetry oi
which they aresoillustriousanexample. “

Aa in the case oi Book 1, we can say nothing oi the date. All that we know is

that vv. 171, 172 seem to have been written just after the battle oi Actium: but tho
