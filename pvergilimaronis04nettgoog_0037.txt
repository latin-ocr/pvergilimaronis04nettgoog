xxxiv VIRGIL AND HIS ANOIENT omncs.

But Virgil (Macrobius 1. 24. 7) was charged also with using bei
barian, thetis, non-Iatin words. 'l'here is a very short ansvert
this in the sixth book of the Saturnalia (4. 23) “necnon et Punic:
Oscisquo verbis usi sunt veteres: quorum imitationeVergiliusperegrit
verba nou respuit.” The instances given are anae, “Gallicavoxqr
feri boves significantur,’' aud canona On am Servius ou Geor
2. 374 says ‘⁴ edueetree ari, ie. boves agrestes, qui in Pyrenaeo mon
nascuntur, inter Gallias et Hispaniae posit0.” On camarae Macrobi
has virtually the same note as Servius and Philargyrius ou Georg.
' 55, and is probably therefore drawing upon the same source, which
hope to show was either the De Vertorwm Sipaptoata ol Verri
Flaccus, or some work immediately dependent upon it.

In the following chapter virgil is defended on the ground of aucit
precedent for the use of several words, partly simple, partly componi
“quae ab ipso fieta creduntur.’' The simple words are Maleil
petulcae, liquidae as au epithet of iyais, tastis in the sense of bit
auritum the compounds are turicremas, Arcitenens, alatreta, oeliooi
vitisator, noctivagae, nubigena, ambraoalam, disolado. Anda simi
plea is urged in favour of certain apparently new sensas given
Virgil to ordinary words, aa to additae in Tearos addita Iaao: to oo
in amoenitatibus andorn: to agmen ih leni fluit opmiae Theyt

maniatium in tempestivam eitoie evertere pinam.

Servius has short notes only on additae, terra, and umbracula
6.90, 11. 601, Ε. 9. 42 [Dan.])‚ which agree in substance with thos
Macrobius, but are mere abridgments of them. On liquidae Ser
(Dan.) on 11. 6. 33 quotes the same passage from Lucretius
Macrobius.

Ι We may here notice some other criticisms of the same kind
served by other authors. Gellius 1. 21. 5quotes a note of Hyg
on the word amaror: “non enim primus finxit hoc verbum Verg
insolenter” (implying that Virgil had been accused of inventing
word) “aed iu carminibus Lucretii inventum est, nec est asperi
auctoritatem poetae ingenio et facundia praecellentis.” Quintili
5. 65 mentions an objection to the word imperterritam, noticiny
fact that the two prepositious contradict each other; and Servii
A. 10. 770 seems to be making excuses for Virgil. So Servi
433 (Dan.) foetebant, “nova locutio, comm et rotae instabe
10. 835 (Dan.) acclinia, “quis ante huuc”? 12. 7 “latroraem,

torem: quis aute hunc? Varro tamen dicit hoc nomen posseh
