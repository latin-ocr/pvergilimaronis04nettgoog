01 001000 00101001 terseuess. Owing 10110 nature 01 110 subject, the
passages iu which Virgil has directly copied Hesiod are almost entirely
0001100110 110 first two-thirds 01 110 FirstBook 01110 Georgica. We
may conjecture that he may have been indebted iu later parts 01 110
poem 10 1001 Ηο010110 writings, but we shall be conjecturing with few
00 no data. Enough however has 1000 said to show that 11 110 rural
poetry 01 Virgil bears the impress 01 0 genius uulike that which pro·
duced the rural poetry 01 Ηο0101, 11 10 001 because the Roman poet
made uo attempt to model his work ou the Greek.

⁴ 'l'he same good fortune which has preserved to us the most im·
000100101 Ηο0101’0 agricultural poems enablas us to judge 0100 01
Virgil’s obligations to another writer, whom he has nowhere named or
ucknowledged. In the Phaenomeua aud Diosemeia‚ 00 Prognostica, 01
Aratus, we harae specimen 01 110 diductio poetry 01 110 earlier
Alexandrian school. (1100000010 translated both werke, speaks 01 him

the early 0011000 01 110 1110 helps us 10 explain the apparent anomaly by
telling 00 that his Phaenomeua is 0 metrioal paraphrase 010100011οο by
Eudoxus, made at the request 01 110 royal patron, Antigonus Geneatae.
He was iu 1001 0 metaphrastes, oue 01 0 class 01 writers not uuoommon
iuthe 10100 times 01 Greek literature, who paraphrased the works 01
other authors, sometimes versifying 0 prose writer, et others transposing
0 0001, sometimes turning a hexameter poem into iambica, 01 others
preserving the metre while they altered the words. Sometimes 0
successful metaphrase became in its turn the subject 01 metaphrastic
ingenuity. Aratus himself was rewritteu in iambica by oue Marianus,
anunwearied writer, who attempted similar reproductious 01 Theocritus,
the Argonautica 01 Apollonius Rhodius, several poema 01 Callimachus,
Nicander’s Theriaca, and, as Suidas tells 00, many others.⁹ 01110 two
poema 000 10 0000110011 they are to be regarded as two, and not 00
000 falling into two parts, Virgil has been but sparingly iudebted to
the flrst, the plan 01 110 Georgica not leading him to attempt any
description 01 110 stars 00 they appear 10 heaven, which 10 110 subject
01110 Phaenomena. But the other work, the Diosemeia, has been laid
under haavy contributione, 10 1000101 materiale for that account 01 110
