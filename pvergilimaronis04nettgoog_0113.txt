THE TEXT OF VIRGIL.

Tun text of Virgil hasbeen handed down in the condition which
might be loclred for when we remember the fact that his poems had
become a school-book within half a century after his death, and bad
thus been often copied aud passed through the hands of imurderable
scholare and schoolmasters3 so that, literally aud metaphorieally,
totae decolor creet Flaccus, et haereret cipro saligo Maroni. Hyginus
at the beginning, and Probus towards the end, of the first century aa,
were (as we have seen) already compelled to raise questions on the
text of Virgil; a circumstance which may give us a fair idea of the
fortunas which¹ were already beginning to befal it.

The manuscripts on which our text of Virgil is mainly based are the
Vatiuau fragment, the St. Gall fragment, the Medieean, the Palatina,
the Roman, the fragments of the Verona palimpsest‚ and the socelled

‚¹¹ Augustean fragment.¹ All these manuscripts are written in uneial
l characters, and belong at latest to the fifth century au, though none
of them,¹ it would seem, need necessarily be assigned to an earlier
date. Indeed‚ the mistakes in which they all abeund-mistakes which
in many cases imply a defective knowledge of classical Iatinity-
point with much probability to the end of the fourth or the begin·
ning of the fifth century. .Iwill give a specimen from a passage in
the third Georgic (181—214) which is preserved in all the uncial

182, equi.- etqui fragm. Aug.

183, bellantum: bellotuutam originally fragm. Vat.

184, audire: cadere Med. originally. ⁸

186, plausae.- plausa Med. originally.

188, audeat: audiat Rom, aud Med. corrected.

192, compositis, sinuetque.- compositi eiuaetqaoe Rom.

orarum: carram Med. originally.

¹ Neitber the Medieean nor Palatius nor Roman are complete throughout.

¹ Not even the Augustean fragment, which vas at tlrst assigned to the Angrnten
age, and named accordingly.
