the corresponding note in Nonius p. 331. It may fairly be said thet
wherever the Verona scholia bave been preserved, it is the first duty
of a modern commentator to consult them. Readere who heve
followed thie essay so far will have already derived some notion of the
quality of the Verona scholia from the quotations made in the sectione
on Asper and Velius Longus: and they bave been cited in the course
of the commentary wherever any light ie to be derived from thena

Whetber these scholia were compiled before the time of Donatus
and Servius or not, their composition cannot be dated earlier than the
last part of the third century aa, as they mention Haterianus. The
fact that the names of Servius and Donatus never occnr in themis, so
far as it goes, an argument in favour of supposing what their generet
character leade ne to presumo, that they were written before those
commentatore appear on the scene.

AELIUS UONATUS.

This scholar, whom J erome mentione more than once ae his toacher,
lived and taught in the middle of the fourth century at Rome, where
he held the postet orator artie Borrae and the title of vir clarissimae.
Itis unfortunate thet we know nothing of hie commentary on Virgil
but what we learn from, the remarks, moetly polemical, of Servius.
He prefixed to his commentary the Life of Virgil which scholare are
now agreed was the work cf Suetonius.¹ Thia fact, ae well as the
character of hia commentary on Terence, would have led us to expect
a work oi sonnd scholarship from Aelius Donatus: yet, if we may
believe Servius, he was weak both in knowledge and in judgment.
On Α, 2, 798, for instance, he seems to have expressed an opinion
that ea Ilio might stand ae a metrical equivalent for eeilio; he thought
that citae (A. 8. 642)00u1d=diveae; that litua (A. 2. 557) could
mean a spot before the altar, and could be derived from titare; that
Amsanctus (A. 7. 563) was in Lucania; thet “trahunt in moenia ”
(Α. 12. 585) could mean “dilacerant in moenibus,’' and eo on It ie
difficult 50 suppose that the bnlk of bie commentary was not of better

quality than thie. Errors like those just mentioned (and Servius him-

self ie not entirely guiltless of such mietakes) only show how surely
the decline ot scholarship had set in hythe middle of the fourth

century aa, and indeed (if the work of Nonius may be taken as a
specimen) much earlier.
