lvi VIRGIL AND HIS ANOIENT ORITICS.

thus symea crepito, horreo, tremulus, are ull illustrated trom Ennius3
so lyolsuus and octbro,· daedalus and reboo, pactores and liquidus, hum

Lucretius: orciteueru and silvicola from Naevius.
These facts alone might fairly lead ns to suspect that Macrobius is

drawing upon glosses or philologicul works of respectable antiquity.
But the suspicion becomes something stronger when we find that some
of the notes are traoeable tc Verrius Flaccus (daedalus, comune,
petcdcrcs, moritus, and perhaps reboo), that others ure common to Macro·
bins and Nonius, and others again to those two writers, with Sensim
and other later commentatore. For I beve endeavoured to show further
on (p. lxviii. foll.) that the Virgilian notes which are common to Nonius
and the later commentatore eannol be assigned to a later date then thr
age oi Trajan. And the conclusion to which we are led iu the casa ol
the scholia, whose origin we can direotly or indirectly truce, it is
natural to extend to those of whose sources wc ure ignorant

NOTE.

lt was not until alter these sheets bad been seut to prese thet Ι was able tr
procuro two pamphlets‚ by Dra. Linlre and Wissowa, ‘⁴ Do Macrobii Saturnaliorun
lontibus‚'' Breslsu‚ 188⁰. Dr. Linlre, who goes much mors fully than Dr. Wissowt
into the question oi the sources oi the Virgilian criticisms iu Macrobius, has com·
to the conclusion (l) that the additional notas iu Danicl’e fler-vius are ancien
interpolatione: (1) that the Servius oi our commentury stands in no relation ο
dependeuce to the Servius oi the Sotumclio5 (3) thot the ancient interpolatorso
Servius horrowed, iu a grem many instances, directly from Macrobius: (4) tho
there are some ceses, navcrtheless‚ where this cannot liare bean the mss: (5) tha
Macrobius 3. 1-121stelren irum two different manuale, ot uncertain date, cache
which probably mnteined informatius horrowed ultimately from Verrius Flaccus.

With regord to (l) and (3) I would observo that the additional nome iu Daniel
Servius moy be interpolatione, but that whether they are sc or not, they arc, in mg
opinion, taken not from Macrobius, but irom a continuone commentery. For (l
they osten extend without a break over continuans lines: (2) they sometimes gis
informatius which is not found in Macrobius: (3) they sometimes, in a very strikin
way, ignore what is to be found in him, aa notably in the case of his sixth 1)οοῖ
(see p. xlvii— lx.). Ientirely agree with Dr. Linlre as to the relation between ou
Servius and the Servius oi the Saturnalia with regard to Macrobius a 1-12 121

{mpod that he is right, as chapters 10, ll sud 12 may come from th
sc.
