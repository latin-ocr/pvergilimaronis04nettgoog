ΤΟ THE SEGOND EDITION. xiii

without holding myself bound by bis judgment. The more im·

portant varieties 1 bave mentioned iu the notes, particularising
the MSS. in which they are found, and notiaing even transcrip-
tural errors when they seemed to suggest any critical considera·
tions. Doubtless the text of Virgil cannot yet be said to be fixed:
but it is satisfactory to know that so much bas boen added to our
materiale for fixing it. Manutime it may be asserted even with
more confidente than before that there are few writers whose text
is in so satisfactory astate as Virgil’a Variations there are, aud
probably will continuo to be, as some of the most eminent of the
ancient grammarians appear to have made independent recensione,

transcribere have introduced into the text of other authors. The
more important MSS, though not always accurate representatives
even of their own reoension, supply each other’s defecta: thaleae

critical conjecture is almost wholly removed. Even the two
instanees where, in the first edition, following other editors, I
had disturbed the text without any externa] authority, bave now
disappeared. In Eclogue 7, v. 54, Lachmann and Madvig have
shown “ quaeque ” to be the true reading: iu Eclogue 8, though
there is no authority for leaving out the burden contained in v.
76, there is authority for introducing a corresponding bunion after
w. 28, which I have accordingly done.

In tbe notes I have availed myself largely of the lsbours of my
predecessore. Servius and Philargyrius Ι have used constantly,
