somewhat complicated by the relations ol the third book ot Noninat
Charisius, which must now be brielly considered.

Charisius, pp. 70-109, has a section in which, among other instance
oi anomaly and doubtful usage in grammar, the question ot word
with a double gender is discussed. The main characteristica oi thi
section are, (1) that the words are not arranged in alphabetical order
but in small gronps which are sometimes alphabetical, sometimes forme
according to the meaning oi the words, bnt ostem as iar as we cai
see, quite casual; (2) that etruscis constantly laid on the difference ir
meaning oi similar words, or different gandera or different forms, o
tho samo word ; (3) that Persius is the latest author quoted ; (4) tha
the latest authority quoted is Pliny's work dubii cercwas'a· whil
Verrius Flaccus, Iulius Modestus, and Varro aro not seldom cited.

On comparing this section of Charisius with the third book o
Nouius, we lind that upwards oi forty words discussed are commo
to both works: and that in a considerable number ot instances
passage quoted in Charisius by way oi illustrationis also cited t
illustrate the same word in Nonius. This is the case, ior instans«
with aluus, coquis, balteus, cinis, contagio, cola, meus, frenas, fmus
grec, intubus, praesepio, pacis, polientes, penus, papaver, semo, sibilo
scapeia, stirps, tapete, culpus.

It must be added, however, that it soldom, if ever, happens that th
coincidence iu the passages cited extends to more than one quotatic
among several addnccd.

The section of Charisius differs, however, from the third book·
Nonius in three important particulare. Iu the first place, it does u·
treat merely oi the question of gender, but oi other difficulties of for
as well, es of anomalics in declension, the comparison of adiectirr
the formation of adverbs‚ and the derivatico of nouns3 secondly,
is not arranged alphabetically 3 and thirdly, it considers differenoes
gender very often ss indications oi difference in meaning, whi
Nonius confines himself almost entirely to the question of torm,

It is reasonable, then, to inter that this section ot Charisius w
drawn from some work which dealt with anomaly in formation in
sporadic and miscellaneous way, not by way oi lists strictly drav
up in alphabetical order, cr confined to particular branchos of t
subject.

Proceeding now to compare this part oi Charisius with the cori
sponding parts ol Priscian, we lind the same kind of relation existi
between Charisius and Priscian as between Charisius and Nonii
namely, that Priscian seems iu contrast to Charisius to be drawi*
upon a strictly grammatical work or works. Some of the wor
(about lourteen, I think) are treated by all three writers, Nouii
