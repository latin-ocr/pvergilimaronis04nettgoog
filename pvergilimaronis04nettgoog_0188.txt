BUCOLIOA. EOL. VI.

Te nemus omne canet; nec Phoebo gratior ulle est,

Quem sibi quse Vari praescripsit pagins nomen.
Pergite, Pierides, Chromis et Mnasyllos in antro

Inflatum hesterno venas, ut semper, Ioccho: 15

Serta procul tantum capiti delapsa iacebunt,

Et gravis attrite pendebat cantharus ensa

Adgressi—nam seepe senex spe carminis ombo

Luserat—iniciunt ipsis ex vincula sertis.

Addit se sociam timidisque supervenit Aegle, ιο
