60 P. vanam MARONIS

commemoration ol his birtbdey in tho calendar. In the preceding llologue Virgll
has shown himself disposod to celebrate political ond soeial regenaration under
¹ pastoral images (o parallel which lendso faint plausibility ιο a noticn mentioued
by Philargyrius, that Daphnis stands lor ιιο ill-lated infant Saloninus): in Εοι. a.
46, which the mention oi Daphnis, though only ss a shepherd, slightly connects
with the present poem, be displsys his sympathy with Caesar in particular os the
sbepherd's supposed petron. This symbolizing is merely a result οι the identifica-
tion ol the poet with the shephcrd, disaussed in the Introduction to the Itclognes,
persons snd things offecting the former being dasembed aa offecting the latter, just
as Gallus iu Εο1. 10, being the sbaphord poet's friend, is mado a shepherd himself,
so thot in maintainiog it we ere not, as Keightley thinks, committed to the position
‘⁸ that Virgil, who was perhaps the least original poet ol antiqnity. was the inventor
oi a now species oi poetry.” At the same timo we need not be anxious with Servius
to finda meaning in every detail, as ii the lions sud tigers stood ior tho natione
subd uod by (laesor, or tho lovoly llook which Daphnis led ior the Roman people.
Tha dote of the Eclogne can only be tired with reference ιο Εο1. 2 aud 3 (see v. 86),

· but it moy be conjectured thet it was written soou aiter the order by the triumvirs

ior the commemoration of Caesar's birthdsy, iu 712. Virgil seems to identisy him·
seli with Menalcas, as in Ecl. 9, though there is no dramatis distinction between
the two shepberds Servius, however, flnds sn historioal counterpert lor Mopsus in
