THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxi

IULIUS MODESTUS.

Ribbeck conjectures that this scholar, the freedman of Hyginus
(Suetonius De illustribus Grammaticis 20), who commented 011 Horace,
made also some scattered remarks upon Virgil. I am not aware, bow·
ever, that any Virgilian notes are in existence which can with certainty
be referred to him. The name of Aufidius Modestus occurs (if the
reading be certain) in a note by Philargyrius on the words 0011101010
Histro (Georg. 2. 497); but can we be certain that 7110001110 person is
intended? Ribbeck thinks that 7110 long note in Nonius, p. 377, on
tenos and protinus 0011100 from the quaestiones confessae ot lulius
Modestus. And undoubtedly Philargyrius on Georg. 3. 53 (cruram
tersus) remarks, Modestus tenus pro fine accipit, and Nonius
says ipsnm leuas . . . maxime finem terminumque designat. It is,
however, at least aa probable thet both Modestus and Nonius owed
their information 70 Verrius Flaccus, for in Festus, p. 367, we read
7001ιο significat finem, ut cnm dicimus imotenus. And more of this
note on 7011001 suspect is tc be found in the note of Servius on Aen.
6. 62, hacteuus, hucusque: id est hic sit finis. Nam teras 007 proprie
extrema pars arcus, ut Plautus ostendit (Bacch. 4. 6. 23) “ita intendi
tenus‚” unde tractum 007 ut hacteuus hecusque significet.

However the case may really hare stood, we bava 11010 again, as in
the instance of 7110 note ou bidens, a valuable specimen of the scholar·
ship of the Augustan age.

L. ANNAEUS GORNU'I'US.

Cornutus, the contemporary end friend of Silius Italicus, and the
rerer-ed tutor of Persius, was banished by Nero 1.0. 68. He was the
author of commentariirfeneidos, which are mentioned by Charisius, pp.
100 and 102, and apparently of remarks ou the Eclogues. A few of
1110110700 are quoted in the Verona scholia and in the commentary
of Servius In Aen. 1. 45, be would 11010 preferred “inflixit'’ to
‘⁴ infixit ” as 111010 forcible (vehementias): in Aen. 1. 150, be defended
101007 against voluat, aud in Aen. 9. 348, ba read for “multa morte
recepit” “multa nocte recepit.'’ These specimens do not impress us
very decply with a sense of his critical power3 nor does he always
appear to much advantage 00 an interpreter. In Aen. 9. 675, for
instance, he took “commissa” as equivalent to “clausa”; an inter-
pretation improbable in itself, and which is wholly ignorcd in tha note
on 71110 passage in Nonius p. 249. A few other 110700 of Cornutus,
hardly worth quoting here, may be found in Servius and the Verona
scholia.
