INTRODUOTION. 5

spite of ourselves, to interrogate that nature which underlies the many
varieties of art. Yet we may realize something of the feeling il we go
back to the time when the office of a translator ranked as high in Dug-
lish estimation as that of an original pout-when he that drew Zimri
and Achitophel was thought to have added to hie fame by his versione of
Juvenal and Virgil, and the preparation of the English Iliad and Odys·
sey occupied, perhaps not unworthily, ten ol the best years oi the mind
which had produced the Desay on Oriticism and the Rape of the Lock.

But whatever may be its susceptibility of explanation or illustration
the fact is one which requires to be borne in mind by every student oi
the Dologues. Without the spirit of allowance which we are ready to
enter-tuin as soon as we perceive that a peculiarity is not individua] or
occasional, but general, we should hardly be able to moderate our sur-
prise at the numberlese instances of close and indeed servile imitation '
which an attentius perusal shows us at once. Itis one thing to accept
broadly the statement that Virgil is a copyist, end quite another to
follow him line by line and observo how constantly he is thinking of¹
his guido, lookiug to him where a simple reliance on nature would have
been not only iar better, bnt iar more easy and obvious, and on many
occasions deviating from the passage immediately before him only to
cest a glauce on some other part of his model.¹ Tityrus, Galatea,
Amaryllis, Corydon, Thestylis, Menalcas, Damoetas, Amyntas, Aegon,
Daphnis, Thyrsis, Micon, Lycidas, are all names to be found in the
muster-roll of Theocritus; and of those not included therein there is
not one (if we except, what are really· no exceptione, actual historioal
personages) which ie not referable to a Greek, perhaps a bucolic
original. Corydon addresses Alexis in the language used hy Poly·
phemus to Galatea: boaets in the same way oi his thousand sheep and
his neveniailing supply of milk: answers objections to his personal
appearance in the same way by an appeal to the ocean mirror: paints
in similar colours the pleasures oi a rural life: glauces similarly at
the pets he is nearing for his love: and finally taxes himself for his
folly, and reminds himself that there are other loves to be found in
the world, in language which is as nearly as may be a translation from
the eleventh Idyl. Menalcas and Damoetas rally each other in words
horrowed from two neighbonring Idyls: two others supply the
language in which they make their wagers: while a large proportion
of the materiale for their amoebeau display is to be found in the same
or other parts of Theocritus, scattered up and down. In the friendly
rivalry ot Menalcas and Mopsus the depreciation oi Amyntas, the
grief of the wild beasts for Daphnis, the epitaph, the apotheosis in
