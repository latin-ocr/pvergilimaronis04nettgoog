ΤΗΕ ΑΝΟΙΕΝΤ COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxiii

may infer almost with certainty that had the Verona scholia or any
other commentery οι equal fulnese come down to ue unimpaired‚ we
should hare found that Servius was indebted ιο asperto a tar greater
extent thau we should otherwise hare been Ied ιο suspect. Many of
the numerous quotations from Terence and Sallust ecattered through
the notes ot Servius are, I cau hardly doubt, taken trem Asper, who, as
we shall see iu a moment, was fond oi illustrating hie notes from Sallust.

The remarks of Asper, whether they refer ιο matters of textnal
criticism or oi interpretationem for the most part echolarlike aud
interesting eren when they fail ιο carry conviction. In Aen. 10. 539,
ιο preferred to read insipaibwe armis to insignibus eltis, baeiug hie
preference on a quotation ιιοιιι Sallust. Bnt there can hardly ιο a
doubt that Probus was right here in reading altre. Iu Aen. 10. 673
ιο was clearly right in 'reading quoae, not quoave, and iu line 737 of
thesemo book ae clearly wrong in reading ciria ior viri. In 11. 8011
should be inclined ιο iuter from the note iu Servius that Asper was led
from an apparent parallel in Sallust ιο read carce, ιιο old genitive
singular, tor cerae. Iu G. ι. 238, ιο (aa we learn from the Barna
scholia) rightly defended ιἰι voluere as against ia volana.

of Asper's sense and insight as au interpreter all remaining iudi·
catione would lead us to think highly. In Aen. 9. 418, for instance,
ιο pointed out that per tempas armaque must betakeu as = inter temper
alawicum in Georg. 2. 324 (vere ramea ιονναο) hie good sense told him
that terrae was nom. pl, not (as Donatus took it three centur-ies after·
warde) the gen. siug; iu Aen. 9. 886 ιο took imprudens ae: -ipnorcm
ae οοοοίιοο. Other explanatione ot his appear more ingenious than
soundzas ,ior instance, when m 10. 188 ιο took crirwn acetrum ιο
mean ccccc vestrae arctationis.- or when ιιι Aen. 2. 305 he explained
ιιοιιοιιο flrcnine as=mcpao fhemice: or iu Aen. 4. 146 picti Agathyrsi
es stipatam, tattooed, au opinion from which Servius discente: or in 9.
678 armati ferro as=serrea corde habentes. Someof hie notes on points
cf interpretation appear ιο heva coms from Verrius Flaccus. Thus he
esys on Aen. 10. 6 (see Scholia Veronensis) that quiam is an archaio
word. Servius, whose note does not name Asper bnt ie probably
indebted to him, quotes quinam from Ennius. Now this was aleo
the case with Verrius Flaccus’ note on the word (Faetus, p. 257),
though the instances quoted by Festus and Servius are not identical.
So also perhaps with the uota ou einum lectis in the Verona scholia on
ael. 7. 33 “ Asper. Sirmm est vas vinarium, ut Cicero significat, non,
