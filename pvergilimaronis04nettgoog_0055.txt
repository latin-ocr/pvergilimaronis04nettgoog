blamed for want of invention in his incidente, or for observing a wrong
order and adopting an artificial style in his catalogues, or for forgetful
repetitions of the same name, or inconsistency in his narrative, or
divergeuce from Homer, or false taste, or bad mythology, or other
minor faults akiu to these (pp. xxxvii.-xliii.); (3) those in which Virgil
is deelared to have fallen below Homer in similar and other passages
horrowed from him (pp. xliv. xlv.); (4) those iu which he is charged
with ignorares of religione antiquities (p. l. foll).

Now if Iam right in sayiug that these criticisms are expressed in
the same venemens but idiomatic style; if it be trus, as it is so far asI
have observed, that they ars all directed against passages iu theAeneid
(the only exceptionis au apparent oue, Maerob. 3. 11. l, where Georg.
1. 344 is quoted; but this is instautly followedby a line from tha
eighth Aeneid: in octov0)-it ia natural to infer that they come from
the Aeneidemastioe of Carvilius Pictor, which is quoted hy Servius ou
Aen. 5. 521.

Besides this, two other works ef hostile criticism ars mentioued by
Suetonius: the vitia of Herennius and the furta of Perellius Faustus.

Itis possible, though I do not like 10 say more, that the criticisms
quoted ou p. xxx. foll. were taken from the work of Herennius. As te
the furta, it is very difficult to prenouuce with any amount of assurance
. what was the scope and extent of the work. It may or may not have
included collectione of Virgil’s plagiarisms from Homer and the Greeks,
as wellas of passages taken from Latin authors. But 1 am inclined
in any ease to suspect that the passages from Iatin authors collectae
in the sixth book of Macrobius came directly or indirectly from this
work. It is remarkable that iu this book there are apologetie remark!

se often, by Macrobius into a context where it is out of place. N 01
these general remarks about plagiarism would have been botta
in place at the head of the passages from Homer collected in the liftl
book: and I am tempted therefore to suppose that they were suggests
by observatious ou this question which Macrobius found in ths work
from which he gettha instances quoted in Book VI. This work ma
or may not have been the furtu of Perellius Faustus. But it seems i
any ease to have been a work which Servius did net much nse, f(
