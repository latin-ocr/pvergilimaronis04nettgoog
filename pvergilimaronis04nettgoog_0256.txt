INTRODUOTION. 139

mitting to a dispensation in which those who would live must labonr,
is identical with the lessou which he draws irum his brieler view of the
legendary antiquities of his subject. The description of the plough is
irem Hesiod‚ though the later poet, in spite oi his evident anxiety to
atteia exaetnees of detail, does not corne up to the iulness of the earlier.
The very meagmneae oi Virgil’s paragraph about the lncky aad nnlucky
days, whether it be true or no that the precise substance ol it is
horrowed from another writer,⁷ may indnoe ns to earmise that he would
not have given a paragraph to the subjectat all, but for his defereuoe
to the example of Hesiod. The famous storm-piece in the Georgica was
evidently suggested by the winter-picco in the Works and Days, both
being introduced to warn the former of the dangers to which he is liable
in his calling, while each is evidently intended ιγ ite author as a
specimen of elaborate description, at the same time that it is cuncus
to eontraat Virgil’s rapid enumeration oi the more striking features of
the soene, the continuone burst of rain, the levelliug oi the crops, the
swelling of torrent and sea, the flashing of the lightning, the terror of
man and beust, the fall oi the mountain peak, and the howliug of the
wind, with the Dutch fidelity oi drawing with which Hesiod repre·
mnted a single point, the effect· of the eleet on the animale, how it
pierres some and fails to pierce others, and how the wilder sort scud
to their dens, like an old man moving on three legs, with his back
rather broken than bent, and his head lookiug down to the ground.
Not less instructive is the parallel between the two poeta in the lines
where they speak of the coming in of the warm westher, “when
lamba aud goats are at their lattest‚ eadwine at its mellowest.”
Mr. Ruskin might appeal to the sequel of the passage in Hesiod, the
wish for a sheltering rock, eadwine of Biblos, eud a cake raised by
yeast, and goat's milk, and the flesh of a cow that has not yet calved,
and oi flrstling kids, as a prooi οι ιιο utter subordination oi any
feeling οι ιιο pictoresque in the early Greek mind to a sense of phy·
sicul comfort3 while it would be only just to note that Virgil‚ in talking
oi the pleasure ot mid-day sleep, and of the thickness of the shadowing
foliage on the mountaius, hae at any rate omitted the grosser and more
purely corporeal accessories oi meat aud drink. Virgil may be said
also to follow Hesiod in his natural calendar, generally fixing the
time of the year ιγ ιιο rising or setting oi some rinnand once or
twice noting the return oi a season by the return of a bird, anch es the
stork or the swalluw. As in the Eclogues, the stately march oi his
diction has in it nothing oi agricultural simplicity; yet there ere
instancea in which he has imitated the proverbial quaintness oi some oi
