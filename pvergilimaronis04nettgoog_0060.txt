THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

Ir was not long before the poeme of Virgil began to afford matter
for discussion to lexicographers, grammariana, and writers on an-
tiquity. The first scholar who actually lecturod upon Virgil was
Quintus Caecilius Epirota, for information about whom we are entirely
dependent upon Suetonius (De Grammaticis, 16). He was, it appears,
a freedman of Pomponius Atticus, the friend of Cicero, and was born
at Tusculum. His cognomen suggests that he may bave been the
child of Epirot parents, brought over, perhaps, from the estates of
Atticus iu Epirus. The daughter of Atticus was married to Marcus
Vipsanius Agrippa, and Caecilius was tutor to this lady. On account
of a suspicion which arose against him with regard to his conduct in this
relation he left the family of Agrippa, aud lived henceforth ou terms
ot intimate friendship with the poet Cornelius Gallus. His character
was so unfavourably regarded by Augustus that this intimacy was
the occasion of one of the graveet charges brought against Gallus by
the emperor. After the condemnatiou and death of Gallus, Caecilius

opened a school for a few young meu, to whom bo lectured ou Virgil
and other contemporary poete. Whetber this was before Virgil’s
death or not thera is no evidence to decide A verse written upon him

by Domitius Marsus-
“ Epirota, tenellorum nutricula vatum?

seems to be pointed at the real or supposed effeminacy of his character.

Verrius Flaccus, the compilor of the first Latin lexicon ever written,
must bave paid a great deal oi attention to Virgil. His work Dc
Verborum Significatu has, aa is well known, survived only in tbe
abridgmeuts of Festus aud Paulus. Eveu in these, a considerable
number of quotations from Virgil is to >be found; and I am inclined
to think that several of the original glossas of Verrius may be
partially reconstructed from later writers, notably from Nonius and
Macrobius, wbo seem to have preserved them in a fuller form than
Paulus or even Festus. Thus Paulus has preserved the following gloss
on ducdclm (p. 68, Mater), Daedaloma varietate rerum artificiorumque
dictum esse apud Lucretiam tereus, apud Ennium Minervam, apud
