Quicherat. The references to Forbiger’s Virgil have been co
rected, where necessary, to suit his fourth edition, in which
change or modification of his former views is sometimes obser
able.

For the Life of Virgil prefixed to the previous editions Ι har
substituted anew memoir, and have added three essays, on tl
ancient critice of Virgil, on the ancient Virgilian commentator
and on the text of Virgil. These essays will, Ι hope, be four
useful as making more intelligible the allusione made in tl
notes to the manuscripts and to the ancient commentaries. 'l
the last essay is added a list-the first complete list thath

ln the essays on the ancient Virgilian commentators and
the text of Virgil I need hardly say that Ι have been much
debted to Ribbeck's Prolepomana. The scope and aim of Ribbec
treatment of the subject is, however, somewhat different from t*
which I have had in view, nor am I always able to agree with
conclusione. Ihave attempted to ascertain approximately
date, or rather the period, to which the Virgilian notes which
common to N onius and the later commentatore should be assign
a point which, so far as Ι know, has not been fully discussed
this connection either hy Ribbeck or by any other scholar, thor
