ΤΟ 'l'Hll FOURTH EDITION. ix

been treated reeently by Hertz, Riese, Schmidt, and Sohottmfiller.
What I have written ie offered not as a final solution of the many

difficult problems involved in the subject, but as an attempt to
break ground ina region as yet imperfeotly explored.

In these essays I have endeavoured in all cases to distinguish
between the Vulgata of Servius and the additional notes published
in Daniel's edition. But I have not thought it necessary to do
this in the oommentary‚ as the antiquity and high value oi these
notes, whether they be regarded as interpolatione or not, make
them quite equal in importunae to the Vulgate lor all purposes of
interpretation or textual oritioism.

I have retained the spelling Virpil in deferenoe to Conington’e
authority, though no length of literary assooiation ean, in my
opinion, make it oorreot.
