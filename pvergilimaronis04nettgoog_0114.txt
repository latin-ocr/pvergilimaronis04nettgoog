'Phe Medicean and the Palatina contain many corrections, partly
from the hands of the copyists who wrote thorn, partly from others of a
not much later date. But did our text of Virgil depend on any one of
the uncials, it would be full of corruptione. To take another instance,
what cau be worse than the error of Pal. in Georgic 2. 315, pertudit
coemto for persuadeat caetori Fortunately, however, the errore of
one manuscript can often be corrected by the readings of another, or
by the light of testimony ufforded by the ancient commentatore and
grammarians.

Ihuve already endeavoured to show that much of the material col·
lected by Servius, Philargyrins, and the writers of the Verona and
Berne scholia is ultimately derived from writings belonging to the
first or early second century au. It follows that where these com·
meutaries mention, as they not seldcm dc, readings which differ from
any of those giren in our manuscripta, those readings may very pro·
bably be entitled at least to serious consideration. Instances of this
phenomencu are to be found iu Georgia 1. 508, where the text known
to Nonius and the author (whoever he was) of Servius' note on Aen.
12. 304 read foveantur ,- in Georgic 2.177 the text followed by Nonius
had melenriu, a reading mentioned by Philargyrins; in Georgic 3.
415, Nouius and Servius read provi nidore, not provee ,· in Aen. 2. 62
Nonius read οοτοονο dolo, not dolor, a variant mentioned by Servius.
In all these cases, and many othere which are noticed in the oom-
mentary, the commentatore approre or register a reading unknown
to the manuscripts. Iu Aen. 7. 773 there can be no doubt that the
reading of Probus, Phoebigenam, isto be preferred to that of the
manuscripts.

Such variatione between the commentatore aud the manuscripts add
to the probability of the conclusion at which Ribbeck bas arrived on
other grounds, that our manuscripts are ultimately deiiced from one
archetype, itself‚ no doubt, full of vadante and corrections, but repre·
senting a text different from that followed, in some cases, by the

authority or authorities from whom the notes common to Nonius,
Servius, and tbe other ancient commentatore, are derived. 'l'o decide
