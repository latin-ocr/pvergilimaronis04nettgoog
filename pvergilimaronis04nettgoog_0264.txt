INTRODUOTION. 147

To inquire into the points ef dissimilarity between the De Rerum
Natura and the Georgica is virtually to inquire inte the causes which
have made the latteruniformly popular, while the former has been com·
pnratively neglected. The anawer is net te be found in the difference
of their subjecta. 'Phe materialism cf Lucretius is cold and cheorless
enough: but the details of plengbing and fallewiug, ef budding trees
aud traiuing vines, ef tattening bulla aud euriug sick sheep, are notin

themselves more inviting, at least te an unprofessienal render. Neroan
it be said that Lucretius falls, where ench writers es Aratus aud
Nicander fail, from inferiority in poetical power. The invocatieu to
Venus, the picture of theold age of the world, the expostulation of
nature with the mortal who rapinas at his mortality, the pertrait of the
seaaens aud their attendants, and ether passages that might be named,
appeal to the imagination perhaps more strongly thau any thing which
can be adduced from the Georgica. But it is the artistic part of poetry
—that which I have attempted to characterine in the Introduction to
the Eelogues-which has the meet onduring ebarm for the generality
oi readers : and thereitisthat Lucretius falls short and Virgil succeeds.
Lucretius wrote before the medulatien of the Latin hexameter was
thoronghly understood, before the strength and weaknesa of tbe Latin
language, ‘quid possit oriri, quid nequeat,' had been sufficiently tested.
Even iu his finest passages the versificatiou ia monetaneus, the diction
cumbrons and diffuse: his lines follow each ether with a certain uni-
formity, each containing a given portion of the sentence, instead oi

being fused together into a complex end inextricable harmeny: the ⁸

words are arranged in a proeaic order, adjectivae and substantivas
coming together, though beth may be terminated by the samo soundt
sometimes weare surprised by a new and startling metapher, sometimes
wearied by expressions which appear to be mere surplusage. In Virgil,
en the contrary, the imaginatien may or may net be awakened, bnt tbe
teste ia almost invariably satisfied. The superiority ef his versificatien
to that of any earlier author whose werke have come down to ns is aeme-
thing extraordinery. His linea are as far removed from these of Lucre-
tius or Catullus as Pope’s are, 1 do net say from Dryden's, but from
Spenser’s. Neverharsb or extravagaut, bis language isatthe sometime
never mean or trivial. The position ef bis words is a study in itself.
Even where he takes a line or phrase from a previous writer, he incer-
poretee it with a slsill which, in the absence of evidenceto the fact, might
make us think that he is net appropriating another's, but reclaiming
his own. This difference is still mere perceptible in the strictly didactio
parts, the stapla, infectos the two poems. Few of those who read the
De Rerum Natura rendit contiuuonsly: few, if any, ef those who read
the Georgica read them in any other way. 'l'here is however another
