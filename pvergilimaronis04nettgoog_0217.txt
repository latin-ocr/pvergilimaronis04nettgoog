MOERIS.

nomae. MOERIS.

Tne historicel occasion of this Eologue hes been al ready adverted tc in the Introduction
to M. 1. After obtaining e promise of protection, Virgil, so says the truditionel ec·
count, returned to his property, when he found his entrance resisted end hia life
meneeed by an intruding soldier, whose name is variously given es Arrius, Claudius,
or Milieuus Toro. He sought sufety iu flight, end mede a eeoond appeul ιο the higher
authorities, which this time vves orowned with more permanent success. Rueeus
conjectures thet the present Eclogne wes in fect e poeticel petitiou presented to Vama
or Octavianus Certainly it is skilfnlly contrived ιο interest the reader in the poet's
fevour. Moeris, oneof the servants, is going ιο the town, Mantus doubtless, witlr
pert of the farm produce, which he is to giveto the usurping proprietor‚ when be is
stopped by a neighbour, Lycidas, reletes his end his mester's troubles, aad receives
e werm expression of sympethy at e loss which hed eo nearly fellen on the whole
. dishict by the doeth of their illustrious compatriot, some of the poet’s verses being
quoted by wey ol showing how great that loss would have been, while Vtrg.’s suo-
oessful return is hinted et es en event which will produce further poema There ia
acompliment to Varus (v. 27), aud another to Caesar (v. 46).

'l'he fremeworlr is more or less borrowed from the θαλύσια of Theocritus (idyl 7),
the most personat of thet poet’s vorke, the first part of which is teken np by un
eooouut of e country welk, in the course of which Lycidas, a gontherd, end a fumone
singer, eomes up with Sirnichides, the representetIve of Theocritus, end consents ιο
sing with him as they jeurney elong. Some posanges in the Eologue are modelled
on passages from other Idyls which ere referred to in the notes.

As there ere no hille or beeohes in the Mentuen terrItory, which, if euy, must be
referred ιο vv. 7 foll, the eceuery would seem to be imaginery or confused, e conclu·
sion confirmed by v. 57. (See however note et the eud of the Eclogues.)

The allegoriuing interpretation spoken of in the Introduction to E. l hes been
upplied here, though only iu thecuae of Amaryllis (v. 22), who has been supposed ιο
represent Rome. Moeris tac, like Tityrus, has been thought ιο be the poet’e lether.

The correspondeuoe between the specimeus quoted from Meneloes’ poetry, Lycides
end Moeris first repeating tbree, then flve lines each, is donbtlese intentionel. See
the lust peregraph of the Introduction to the Eclognee.

The dete of the poem ie leter then thet of Fclogue 5 (see v. 19), end consequeutly
thau those of Eelogues 2 and 3. 1ts relation ιο Eulogue 1 we ean hardly determine
in the present stateof our knowledge, though Serv. pronounoes thet Eologue ιο be
the eerlier of the two. [See Excursus et the end of the Eclogne.-H. N.]
