P. VERGILI MARONIS

Nam sine vi non ulla dabit praecepta, neque illum
Orando flectes3 vim duram et vincula capto

Se recipit, facile ut somno adgrediare iacentem.

Tum verbe eludent speeies atque ora ferarum3

Fiet enim subito sus horridus, atraque tigris,
squamosusque draco, et lulva cervice leaena,
