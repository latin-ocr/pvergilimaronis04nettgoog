pigeous. We may agree with the last editor 61 the Nicandrea¹, that
notwithstanding these specimeus 61 his work, Nicander probably went
over much the same ground 66 Virgil, only taking a more comprehen-
sive view of his subject; but we have only Quintilian’s authority 161
surmising that the resemblance between the two pcems extended
beyond 1116 66616. Equally tantaliaiug is the conditiones our know·
ledge about another work by Nicander, the Μελισσουργικά, the title ol
which promises to throvv a flood 61 light on Virgil’s Fourth Book, while
the notices 61 11 that have been preserved merely tell us that the author
used θύμ61,1111616,66 6 masculine noun, that he applied the verb
1116111611 the reading is right, to the drosos, iu what connexion we

. know not, aud that he placed the original birth-place 61 thebeos iu ·

Crete, in the days oi Saturn-the last point, at any rate, being cue in
which Virgil may seem 16 have followed his example. But if we ara
ignorantes those works 61 Nicander about which, aa studente of
Virgil, we should have most wished 16 be informed, we can at any rate
satisty onrselves as 161116 general character 61 the poet by lookiug 61
his two extant productione, the Theriaca and the Alexipharmaca Like
Aratus, he appears 16 have been a metaphrastes ; like him, 116 appears 16
bave been honoured 61161 his death by having his works subjected 16
the same process which he had tried 66 those 61 others, aud he receives
from Cicero a similar equivocal compliment, that 116 had written ad·
mirably on agricultural subjecte, without ever having had the slightest
connexion with agriculture. But though the translator 61 Aratus
includes tliom in the same eulogy, they appear 16 have received very
different degrees of consideration. One 61 the points on which 1116
161661 editor 61 Nicander has laboured nicet is to prove that his author
was never much read. ‘Nicander parum lectus' is a thesis which is
dilated 66 61616 than once in his Prolegomeua. The poet had his meta·
phraates; he had his scholiasts; 116 666616 6166 16 have had his inter-
polators; but he was but little read, even by those who, journeying
61611116 same ground, might have been expected 16 evall themselves ol
the 66166 61 61611661 traveller. Dioscorides, Celsus, Scribonius Largus,
Galen, Serenus Sammonicus, Oribasius, Aetius Amideuus, Paulus
Aegineta, Theophanes N onnus, and Ioannes Actuarius, are successively
passed under roview, 16 show that 11161 attended to Nicander vary
slightly or not at all. Nor can it be said that 116 16 likely to receive
from modern readers the favour which was denied him by those who
approachcd more nearly 16 his own time. The interest which attaches
16 him is purely historical and philological. He is supposed 16 have
lived ninety years after Aratus; and his lauguage shows plain marks
