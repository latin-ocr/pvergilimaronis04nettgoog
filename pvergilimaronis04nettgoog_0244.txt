BUOOLIO POETS OF ROME. 127

on the berk ot a neighbouring cherry-tres. Air, earth, and water are

involred to carry the lement to the ears of Meliboeus, whom the¹ poet
theu proceeds to panegyrice.

⁸⁴ Longa tibi cunctisque din spectata senectus,
Felicecque anni, nostrique novissimus aeri
Circulos, innocuae clauserunt tempora ritae.
Nec minus hinc nobis gemitus lacrimaeque tuere,
Quam si florentia mors invide pelleret ennea.
Nec tenuit talis communis oense querellas:
Heu, Meliboee, iaces letali frigore segnis
Lege hominum, caelo dignus, canente suueuia,
Concilioque Deum. Plenum tibi ponderis sequi
Pectus eret: tu ruricolam discernere lites
Adanerus, varias petiens mulcendo querellas
Sub te ruris amer, sub te reverentie iusti
illoruit, ambiguos signavit terminus agros
Blanda tibi vultus gravitas, et mite serena
Fronte supercilium, aed pectus mitius ore.”

The usual topics then succeed: the gods of the country bring gilts
iu honour of the dead: trees and herda, ‘nostra armenta,' repeat his

species of promotion which these shepherds appear especially to desire,

confusion of Greek and Iratin.

The second Ilclogue is entitled Doncce, the name of a girl who has
been removed by her parents from the passiouste pursuit of two shepherd
boys, Alcon end Idea, and whose absence they accordingly lament iu
amoebean strains. It is modelled to a certain extent ou Calpurnius’
second and third Eclogues, not without some exaggeration and coameness
oi bandling, which are due to the author himself. The images in which
the lovers express their longiug are, as usual, horrowed from Theocritus
orVirgil: onerecommends himself on account of his wealth,theotber on
the score of 'his personal appearance: one talks of all nature as blighted
to him while Donace is away, the other reminds her that gods have led
a shepherd's life: and evening as usual comes in to stop the singing.
The only noticeable passage is about a tame nightingale, which Alcon
has sent us a present to Donace, though the thought gaius but little
from its expression.
