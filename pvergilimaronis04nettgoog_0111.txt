. cviii THE ANGIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

berne cut by the general coincidence between the notes bearing the
names cf Philargyrius and Flagrns.

The compiler cf these scholia was a Christian, and fond oi alle-
goriaing, a process tc which Servius and the older commentatore are
generally averse. Oi his authorities Τ. Gallus and Gaudentius, and
their relations tc the older commentatore, it is very difficult tc affirm
anything with certainty. Comparing the notes attributed tc Gallus with
those of Servius, 1 find that while cn G. l. 3 Servius and Gallus talis
opposite views, the twc usually correspond, though not so closely ae to
preclude the hypothesis that one is independent cf the other. For
instance, cu G. 1. 13, Gallus adds a remark which is not in Servius,
and so on G. 1. 81. On G. 1. 8. 149, their nctes are tc thesemo
purpose, though expressed independently: elsewhere they are nearly
identical.

Did Servius then bcrrow from Gallus, or Gallus frcm Servius? 'Phe
fact that on one occasion their viem are opposite, and that ou others
they are independently cxpressed, seems tc point rather to their having
both borrcwed from the common storo of Virgilian commentary which
I have tried to show had been guthered by the end oi the fourth
century.

lam inclined to draw the same conclusion with regard to Servius
and Gaudentius. Hagen thinks that Servius horrowed from Gauden-
tius as from Gallus3 but although there are numerous instances where
the notes of Gaudentius and Servius coincide, there arc some where
Servius is the fuller (Ε. 8. 21: G. 1. 277, 284: 4. 104, 111), others
where, though Hagen sess traces oi borrcwing, I should be disposed to
say that the commenta were independent (E. 6. 79; G. 4. 122).1

Add to this the fect that Servius is never mentioned by name in the
Beroe scholia, nor Gallus or Gaudentius in the commentary oi
Servius.

Another indication which points to the conclusion that the authorities
ci the Bernc scholia are independent oi Servius und Servius ci them is
the fact that they several times preserve quotations from writers oi
authority of which Servius has nc trace. Thus, on G. 3. 147, they in
common with Philargyrins quote Nigidius Figulus Dc animalibus
while Servius has quite a different note. In other places they quote a
passage which, though absent in Servius and Philargyrius, serves t(
fill up and complete the notes oi the letter. Thus on G. 3. 89 oni
