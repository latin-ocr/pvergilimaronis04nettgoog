6 BUOOLIOA.

most of its circumstances, the complimeuts which shepherd pays to
ahepherd, and the exchange oi presente, are all modelled more or less
closely aiter the Doric prototype. Corydon and Thyrsis are perhaps
more originale yet even they owe something to Menalcas and Daphnis,
as well es to oue or two other Sicilian sbepherds, not only in the
antecedente, but in the conteuts oi their songs; and the eminence to
which Corydon is lifted by his success is similar, though inferior, to
that attained by Daphnis. The dying Damon, or rather the lover
whom Damon personatos, recells in the first part of his complaint the
dying Daphnis, in the lest the slighted Polyphemus: the enchantrsss
who is represented by Alphesiboeus is the same who in the second Idyl
employs even more eharms to bring back Delphis, though the success
which this time crowns her efforts is new. Moeris and bis compacion,
‘ like Meliboeus and Tityrus, talk about 1 subject which, being pert ot
Virgil’s personal history, could not but be his own: yet eren they
supply us with reminiscences from Sicily, partly in the things which
they say 'to each other, partly in their quotations from the pcet's nn-
published verses. The dying Daphnis reappears once more in the
dying or despairiug Gallus: the complaint oi the lover is indeed bis
own, but the circumstances which sur-round him ars copied minutely
from thet song which Thyrsis, the sweet songster from Aetna, sang to
the goatherd in the hot noon under the elm. Dren this enumeration
must fail to gire auy notion oi the numberless instances oi incidental
imitation, sometimes in a single line, sometimes in the mene turn of
an expression, which fill up as it were the broader outlines of the copy.
And yet there cau be uo doubt that Virgil ranked aa an original poet
in his own judgment no less than in thet oi bis contemporaries, and
theton the strength of those very appropriatione which would stamp
a modern author with the charge ot plagiarisrn. His Thalia, be
proudly reminds us, was the first who deigned to disport herself in
the strains of Syracuse, as that was her first employment.[And in
the ninth Eclogue, where he grieves by anticipation, tenderly and
graceiully enough, over the loss which the pastoral world would have
susteined hed he died prematnrely, of the four fragments of his
poctry which are singled out for admiration two are copies from
Theocritus, aud one ot them, the first, so close s copy, and so slight,
not to sey trivisl, in itself, that it ean hardly have been instaneed with
any other view than to remind the reader oi his success in borrowing
and ekilfully reproduciugff It is, in fact, an intimation, made almost inl
express words, that be wis ed to be considered as the Roman Theocritus.

The impression leit by such passages ou the mind oi a considerate
render is very much thet which a modern author, writing without the
restraint of verse, would seelr to produce by a quotation or a direct re·
