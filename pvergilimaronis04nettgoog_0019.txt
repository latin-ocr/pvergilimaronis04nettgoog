xvi PREFAOE ΤΟ THE SEOOND EDITION.

poets, Weber's “Corpus Poetarum;’' for the fragments of
Latin dramatists, Ribbeck ; for those 01 Ennius, Vahlen; for tl
01 Lucilius, Gerlach; for Cicero, mostly Verburg ; for the Sc
tores Rei Rusticae, sometimes Gesner, sometimes Schneider;
the Latin grammaticus, Keil; for Festus, Mulon for Non
generally Gerlach and Roth. This list is perhaps not q.
complete, butI think it contains nearly all those authors
references 10 which are likely to vary according to the edit
used. I fear there may be some cases found in which Ι 1
need an edition not named in it; but the 00100 have been wri
at various places, a large portion of them indeed during vacati
when I have been absent from Oxford, and have in conseqm
only had a certain number 01 my own books about me.

In concluding the Preface to my first edition, I spolie 01
obligations to Mr. Long and his lamented colleagua. Tot
supervision were due the removal 01 many errors, and the 0(
0100 01 some new information. At the same time I said that 1
criticisms had very considerably abated the confidenoe with wI
loffered the volume to the public: and though the favour
opinion 01 most of my reviewers, and the sale of a large im]
sion, seem to show that the work has in the main been appr(
Ihave learned quite enough, both from my own increased
perience and from the observatione 01 others, to prevent me ¹
withdrawing the expression 01 selfdistrust Where so mucl
been successfully questioned, it is impossible not 10 be afraid
there remains behind much more, not only open to dispute
actually erroneous. I can only say, aa before, that I shal
very gratesiss 10 any reader who will help me towards accurac
pointing out my mistakes. Meantime,l may perhaps put
plea for indulgence on account of the wide field over which
notes extend. A body of several thousands of propositione
great variety 01 subjecta can hardly fail to yield 0 large
oentage 01 error.
