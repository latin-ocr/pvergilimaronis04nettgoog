PREFAGE ΤΟ THE SECOND EDITION. xi

pared by us' in concert for publication: those on the first five
Eclogues are based cn some which he composed by himself: and
many passages in both poems heve since been discussed between
us. The editorisl responsibility is however entirely mine, andI
have exercised it freely with reference ιο the materiale which he
allowed me ιο use, edding, altering, and suppressing, as Ι decmed
best One important remark, affecting the interpretation of the
first Eclogue, I have thought it right ιο assign distinctly to him,
ss it appears ιο me both new and valuable.² On the other hund
Ifear it is not impossible that the notes may betray, here and
there, even after the present revision, a trsce of that inconsistcncy
which is perhaps almost inseparable from a divided editorship,
though it is also conceivable that indicatione of this kind may

' hare arinen from changes in my own opinion, such as it is no less

natural ιο expect in the course of a pmtrscted work.

Even a transient glance at the contenta of the present volume
willnhow that the productiori of it must necessarily have been a
work of time. It does not profess, indeed, any more than the

other editions of the Bibliotheca Classica, ιο be awork for the

learned, the result of elaborate original reseerch. N o manuscripts
have been consulted in the formation of the text: every large
portion of the notes may be found in the commentaries of others.
But it is no light thing ιο comment on nearly 3000 lines, line by
line, sven where the meterisls of the note are taken from other

sources Much ιοο depende on the style in which a commentary
is written. I have in genercl studied brevity cf expression,
abridging quotations which might have been given in extenso,
arrd indicating a thought which might easily have been pursued.
A very few lines of type will often represent the employment of
an hour. Before I knew the actual nature of the work, Ι fancied
that an edition cf the whole of Virgil, such as I proposed, might
¹be completed in two or three years: Ι can now only wonder at
the inexperience which suggested the thought.

In writing my notes I heve had no one class of readers ex·
clusively in view, but have aimed at producing a commentary
which should coutain such information as is suited ιο the various
wenta of a somewhat mixed body-those who constitute the
