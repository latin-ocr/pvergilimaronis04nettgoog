18 BUOOLIOA.

no hint in Suetonius or any other ancient authority¹ of a second
edition of the Eclogues. The fourth Eulogue was referred by all the
ancient commentatore to the consulship of Pollio, the name of Pollio
stands iu the text, aud can only be removed by violence. There is
nothing again, either in the style or the matter of the sixth or tenth
Eulogues, which can fairly be held to justify so strange a breaeh with
an excellent historical tradition-H. N.]

There seems no reason to doubt that the order iu which the Eelogues
now stand is that in which Virgil himself arranged them, whatever bear·
ing that may have ou the question of their relative dates. 'Phe last
line of the fourth Georgia, as Wagner remarks, even without the support
of a similar notice by Ovid, establishes the fact that the first Ecloguo
was intended to stand first and give, ae it were, its tone to the whole;
tho exordium of the tenth Eologue speaks for itself. For the titles of
tho various Eulogues, varying as they do iu the different MSS„ the
grammariaus are doubtless to be held responsible. The name Eelopee,
which signifies merely select poems², in this cass the porticus of the
Bucolic volume, is to be referred to the same authority.

Receut German critice, suehasGebauer, in the treatise already referred
to, aud Ribbeck, have supposed themselves to bave found the traces of

symmetrioal arrangement, amounting to something like strophieal corre·
spondanus, throughout the Eclogues. That such a principle was pre·
seut to Virgil's mind during the composition of some of them, the
structure of the amoebean partof Eelogues 3, 5, 7, aud 8 ie sufficient to
prove: nor does it seem au accident that the serape of songs quoted in
Eulogue 9 fall into two pairs of three and five lines respectively3 but
thetis no reason for seeking symmetry iu the Eclogues which are not
amocbean, and torturing the text in order to bring it out.⁸ Itis true
thot the sense is more frequently ended with thelina in the Eologues

¹ Servius, ln na Life, says, it is true, “eurmen Bucolicum. . . . eum conant
triennio scripsisse et ommaduwe.’' But tho werd emendasse (used ulae by Servius os
the Georgica) meane only thet virgil put the finishing touch to ihs Eclegues‚ us
he wus preventcd by death from doing to the Aeneid

² See Foreellini s. v. Eciopo. The irrelevaucy of the term as applied to pastoral
poetry led Petraroh io eenricus emendation, AEplopuee, which he accordingly gave aa
the title to his own Pastorem: and Sponsor, among others, followed the example.
Johnson, who remarks (Life of A. Philips) that the word ean only mean ‘the talk of
geete? not, ee it was intended, ‘the talk of goutherds,’ might have remarked further,
that no sueh formation could have existed iu Greek. The Freueh spelling Eploqw
may be otherwise explained.

¹ Gcbauer's theory obliges him in Ε. 10. 32, 33 to put a lull stop efter ‘periti’
connecting the second ‘Arcades' with tho words that follow. Most readers will, I
think, feel that the rhythmieal benuty of ‘soli cantme periti Arcades' is worth far
more, to modern apprehensione at least, then any gain that can be supposed to
ecorus from the stroplricel arrangement of uu antire Eclogue.
