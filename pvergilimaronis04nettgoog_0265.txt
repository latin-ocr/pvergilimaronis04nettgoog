148 GEORGIOA.

espect in whieh the edvautageis not on the side of Virgil. One great
reason why Lucretius is found to be unreedoble is his enthusiasm for
his subject. Whether he thorougbly understood the Epicurean system
is, I believe, doubted by some of those who have most right to reise the
question: but neone will say thet he did not embrece it with all the
burning energy of deep conviction. Admittiug the uncongeniality of
his subject to Ietin verse and its distentefulness to the vulgar, he hes
good hope thet he shell be ableto make it pelateble to his friend: but
he does not avoid pbilosophieal deteil for tear of being thought tedious

or repulsive. If Memmius is weery‚ the remedy, ho tells him, is netto
hear less, but to beer more.

“Quod ei pigraris paulumve recesseris ab re,
Ηοο tibi de pleno possum promittere, Memmi:
Usque adeo largos haustus e fontibu' magnis
Lingua messueris diti de pectore fundet,

Ut verear ne tarde prius per membra senectus
Serpat, et iu nobie vitei claustra resolvet,
Quam tibi de quavis uno re versibus omnis
Argumentorum eit eopia misso per euris.’' ²

Virgil is equally conscious ef a difficulty, though the manner in which
he expresses it, while partially borrowed from another passage in Lucre·
tius, is characteristically different.⁸ ‘⁶ For myself‚’' he seys, “I too em
well assured how hard the struggle will be for lengnege to plant her
standard here, and invest e theme ιο sleuder with ber own peculiar

. glory: but there is a rapturous charm that whirls me along over Par-

nassus’ lonely steeps; a joy in surmouuting heights where no former

wheel haegorua wey, no eeey slope leads down to the Gestelian spring.”

“ August hunc addere rebus honorem: ” such is the object which he
proposes to himself ι end the way in which he atteius it is by keeping
out of sight the mere prosaic parts of his subject, substituting poeticel
ornament, as I have said elsewhere, lor logical sequence, end too fre·
quently preferriug ambiguity to tedicus repetition. He hed to choose
between the farmer and the reader: end iu his consideration for the one
he has sometimes forgotten the compession which, at the very outset
ol his work,⁹ he professes to feel for the other.

But the question ol the reelity of the Georgies does not wholly de·
peud on the velue oi the work as sn agricultural treetise. It may be
true that Virgil is en inaccurete fermer’s guido, yet true, slso, that he
isa warm eud heartylover of nature. This is a preise whichie usually
conceded to the Georgies without hesitation. Horeoe said thot Virgil
