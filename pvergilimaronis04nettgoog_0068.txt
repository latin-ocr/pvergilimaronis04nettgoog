THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxv

soon began to languish at Rome. But these writers maintained their
reputation 01101 Italy, aud the curiosity of Probus was awakened by
reading some of them with a provincial lecturer. 'l'he stndy of these
suthem inspired him to go 01 10 others, and regardless 01 the fact that
the psius he was spending was likely 10 gaiu him nothing but dis·
credit, he determined to devote his life tc the emendation, punctuation,
and explanation oi ancient texts. Among these he appears to have
paid special attention 10 Terence, Lueretius, and Virgil. Probus pub-
lished little of importance inhia life-time, but left a considerable post·
humous work in the shape oi a “Silva observationum sermonis
antiqni,'’ from which a great deal, Ι suspect, hae filtered into tha work
uf the later grammariaue.

Probus was alive, as we may infer from Martial's address to his third
book (3. 2. 12, “illo vindice nec Probum timeto”), iu 88 am: but
bis merite hed been recognized at Rome some thirty years before.l
He did not open a subsolarium pupils inthe ordinary senesci the
word. But he had admirere with whom, like Socrates in a higher
path cf speculation, he would converse, and perhaps did more in thie
way thau he would have done by direct teachiug to stimulate the love
of antiquity which marks the scholare 01 the generaticu which followed
him. His influence is very marked iu the Noctes Atticae ot Gellius,
who had known and conversed with friends of Probus.

J udging from the remeius oi his notes which have been preserved iu
Servius aud other later writers, one would be inclined 10 essign 1ο him
without question the first place among the commentatore 01 Virgil.
Hie remarks on the text of the poet are of the utmost valna, whether
we regard them ae based 01 his own conjectures, or (as I am more
inclined to suppose) 01 the inspectiou of excellent manuscripts now
lost. That Probus did not spere himself the labour of consulting the
oldest accessible documents we know from Gellius 13. 21. 4, where he
ie said 10 bave examined a manuscriptos the first Georgia corrected
by the hand of Vir-gil 1111111011, with the view of settling the question
whether the acc. pl. uf arbe should be spelt orbe or arbee. Hs had

probably also looksd at good copies of the Aeneid before he appealed
to Aen. 2. 224, 460 and 3. 106 01 the matter. His common sense is

as notabis as his industry. The question, he maintained, would have
besu decided by Virgil not iu pedautic accordauce with a fixed rule,

but according to the jndgment of his ear. v
In Aen. 7. 773 the undoubtedly true reading Phoebiqermm, which is

found in none olom· manuscripts, is due to Probus. It is difficult to
believe that he hit upon this by conjecture, or (to put the seme statement
