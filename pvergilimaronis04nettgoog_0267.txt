150 GEORGIOA.

another use, as showing how he may have been drawn tc rural poetry,
without having felt a decided lore 111 it. But itis difficult to conceive
that a man in whose mind the ambition 11 imitation, the charm 11 recol·
lected reading, aud a taste for conventioual conceptione filled 11 large a
space can have found his delight and solace, at least to the extent sup-
posed, in sympathy with externat nature. The uureelity 11 the pastoral
life in the Eclogues does not indeed prove the existence 11 1111111111-
reality in the Georgics3 but it preparas ns to expect it. Probably
there is no passage iu the Georgica in which sympathy with nature is
more strongly expressed thau that 11 which I have already adverted,
where he contrasts the voceticn 11 Lucretius with his own. He prays
that he may delight iu the country and the streame that 11111111 the
valleys—that he may love river and woodlaud withan unambitious lora.
He siglis for Sperchias and Taygetus, the revel-ground 11 Spartan
maidens, and longe 111 some oue who will set him down in the cccl glans
11 Haemus, and shelter him with the giant shade 11 its boughs. He talks
11 the bliss 11 the man who has wcn the friendship 11 the rural gods,
Pau and old Silvanus, and the sisterhood 11 nymphe. He occupies the
111111 the book with the praisea 11 the country 1111, its tranquillity and
purity, its constant round 11 pleasant employments, its old historic and
legendary renown. But hehas already painted the destiuy 11 ascieutific
iuquirer into nature in colours which can scarcely be intended to be
less glowiug, and declared that his first love is centred there. The very
distinctness with which Lucretiae is indicated as the ideal 11111 which
he primarily aspires is 111111 1 presumptiou that the aspiraticn is in some
sort genuine. There is, indeed, something strange and sad, 11 this were

alternatives, and leaving the choica tc be determined by his mental consti·

words without a distinct consciousness 11 their full meaning, aud to be

two opposite aspecta 11111111. But though such a state 11 mind hes,

mediately follows, the praise 111 country 1111 as affording 111 scope 111
the paine 11 pity or 11 cury, seems to show a lingering sympathy with
philosophic doctrine even after he had resigned himself to an unphilo·
sophic life. Nor is this the only passage in which we find traces 11 1
yeamin'g 11111 philosophy as the true sphera 11 apost. The song 11

from the passage we have just been considering, shows that the con·
