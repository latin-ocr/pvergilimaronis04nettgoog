INTRODUOTION. 155

from beginning to end. The commuuity which ia the subject of 1110
labonrar's care is 110011 0 miraole 01 labour: and the poet 1011110 time
ie absorbed in it. He gives directions as usual to the husbandmen
about the position and construction of the hive, the taking of the honey,
the remedies tor discsse, and the like ε the cares of 0 bea-keeper 010 in
some measure illustrated by the 0101101010 episode in which he tells how
the means 01 producing a new swarm came 1ο be discovered: bathis cn-
thusiaem is reserved 1011110 unflagging toil of the bees themselves, ior
tbstorganized industrytowbichthesuperhumanlaboursoi the Cyclopes
are supposed toturnish no exaggerated parallel-forthat seli-sacriflcing
patriotism which makes them breve death iu carrying home their con-
tributiou tc the common stock 01 honey. In the exordium 01 the First
Book, 01 the end 01 0 summary whichspeaks 01 nothing but human
labour, an epithet is introduced which strikes a ehord, as some have
thought, out 01 harmony with the context, by commemorating the
frugality oi the bec side by sida with the weight 01 experience required
101 rearing and keeping it. Ii that spithet was not intended, aa it may
well 11010 been, to annouuce to the reader that the poem would treat 01
bees as fully as of their keepers, it may at least witness to the division
01 interests 01011 then existing in the poet's mind, and show that in the
brief glauce with which he took in the' whole 01 his subject he thought
10101 man alone, 111101 011 11101001 combine intelligence with energetic
toil.

Suetonius informs us thet the composition 01 the Georgica occupied
001011 years; a statement which appears to meet the 10010 oi the case
as nearly aa possible. The lest date of the Eulognes, as we saw, is
probably 717; the concluding lines oi the Georgius tell us that Virgil
was writing while (100001 was conquering in the East, a time which
seems most naturally to referto the 1101011010 progress of Octavianus
aiter the battle 01 Actium in 724 (see Merivale, 101. iii. pp. 358,
359). Forbiger rightly maintains 11101 there is nothing 10 1010111·
Wagner’s 111010100 imm those 111100, that the poem was entirely com-
posed during the events there spoken of. It is not likely that the
poet reated on his camier five years 01101 the completion 01 the
Eclogues3 it is not likely that he employed himself on any other work:
aud we can easily understand 11101 his habits of composition, aud the
preparation necessary for an undertaking 01 such 0 character aud mag·
uitude, may have made 0 period of 001011 years not more thau sufficient
for 1110 productiou 01 the poem. At the same time it is natural enough
that he should 11010 made alterations init during the remaining years
