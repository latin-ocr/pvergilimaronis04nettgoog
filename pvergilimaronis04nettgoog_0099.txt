and the Verona scholia, and much probably has ionnd its way into the
commentary of Servius. For we find 111 several instances that where
the Verona scholia quote Longus by name, the same note is given in
Servius in an abridged form and without any mention of him: a
phenomenou which must never be lost sight oi in considering the
question of the sources of the Servian commentary, whether the con-
clusion be that Servius is borrowing from Longus, or that the notes of
both are derived from the same source. The principal notes oi Longus
preserved by the Verona scholia are :

(a) A. 3. 693 on the name Plemmyrium, which he (or bis authori·
ties) derived irom πλημύρειν “ideo qnod undique fluctibus undisque
adlnstur.” unis or a similar note is abridged in Servius without
achnowledgment.

(b) A. 3. 705 on palmosa Selinus, paluwsc being explained after
Melissus (l) as meaning “ the mother oi many victore in the Olympio

ames.’'

g (c) A 4. 149. Longus derived eequis from eice iqui, and explained
it as :defensis which again he took as coming from de and surmus,
hot: and so Servius, again without acknowledgment of the source of
his note. So Nonius, p. 33.

(d) A. 5. 488. Longus replied 1ο a carping criticism of Cornutus
on this line. Again Servius gives the gist of this note without
mention oi his authority.

(e) A. 1489011 the word feries for a stag. This note of Longus
seems to be based on the same sources as that oi Nonius p. 307, both

quoting A. 2. 52, where seras is used oi a horse. Agnin Servius
abridges this or a similar note without acknowledgment.

(f) A. 10. 1. Longus hers had a valuable note on the words domm
Olympi, in illustration oi which he quoted cenaculum caeli from Ennius.

(y) A. 10. 551. Longus mentions and solves a difficulty about
Faunus: how could he be mortal ii born of a nymph? The question
is also raised and solved by Servius. The gist of both notes is the
same, bnt they are evidently independent, and probably derived from
a common source.

(h) A. 10. 557. Longus illustratcd the local adverb istic by tw<
passages from the Radani of Plautus.

(i) In A. 10. 215 11 seems that Longus read spectabis for spectabit
saying that the word cenail should be supplied aiter crastina lar
Macrobius 3. 6. 6 has anote of Longus on A. 3. 84, which is alst
given, without any acknowledgment of its source, in the Caesel addi·
tions to Servius on the passage.
