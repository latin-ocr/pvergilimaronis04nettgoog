THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. xcvii

· URBANU S.

Iam not couvinoed by Ribbeck's argument (Prol. p. 167) from the
mention of Urbanus in Servius' note on A. 5. 517, that this com·
mentator was prior·in time to Velius Longus. Longus, we have seen,
made some remarks in answer to a criticism of Cornutus on Virgil’s
alleged mistake in making Aeneas devote to death a pigeon, the bird
of Venus: and it seems that Urbanus had a note ιο the same purpose.
But it would be rash, surely, to infer from this that Longos was
indobted to Urbanus.

On two grounds I am disposed to think that too early a date has
been assigned ιο Urbanus. First, there is not, so far as I am aware,
any mention oi him in the Verona scholia. It may be answered that
the Verona scholia as we have thom are merely a fragment, and that
we cannot therefore he justified in arguing from their silence. Troe:
yet even in their fragmentary condition they preserve quotations
from a great number of commentatore, Asper, Cornutus, Haterianus,
Longus, llisus, Probus, Terentius Scaurus, Sulpicius Apollinaris; and
it would he strange, had the compilor of these scholia known ot a
commentary by Urbanus, that no mention of it should have survived
even in a fragment oi his work.

Secondly‚ the absurdity oi the notes attributed to Urbanus seems ιο
me to stamp them as belonging ιο a later age than that of {lhajan or
the Antoninos. Το take a single instance: in A. 4. 469, “Eumenidum
veluti demens videt agmina Pentheus,” Urbanus seems to have taken
“ agmina ” as meaning the coils oi the Furies’ serpente. It is easy to

imagine how Probus would have dealt with such a remark: or again
with that on A. 4. 624, “nullus amor populis, neo foedera sunto,’'
where Urbanus observed that Virgil had used a legal word, nmio,
“ propter odia hereditaria.'’

censeamus VINDEX, Tnssnnrms SOAURUS‚
SULPICIUS APOLLINARIS.

Caesellius Vindex, the compilor of a lexicographical work in fifty
books entitled Lectiones antiquae, arranged in alphabeticsl order,
is quoted by Gellius, 2. 16. 5, as giving a sensible explanation of
postumo proles in the sixth Aeneid. He took portarius to mean not
“ post patris mortem natus‚” but “postremo loco natus‚” an interpreta-
tion for which he wss taken to task by Sulpicius Apollinaris. Itis
easy to conjecture, though there is no positive prooi of the fact, that
the work of Caesellius Vindex may have been used ιο a far greater
