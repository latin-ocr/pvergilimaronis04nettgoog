BUCOLICA. ECL. VI. 39

Epicurean, though this tradition itself may be merely au awkward attempt to gire an

¹historica} basis to Silenus' song. Like the eighth Eclogua it appears ιο be a sort of
apolcgy ιο his friend and patron for neglecting to celebrate his exploitu, entreating
him ιο except a pastoral legend as a substitute. [What these exploits wero ιι not clear.
Servius says of Varus, ‘⁴ Germanos vicerat, et exinde maximam fuerat et gloriam et
pecuniam consecutus,” anoticewhichalso appears in theBemescholis. and which would
perhaps deservo little attention, were it not thstVirgil speaks distinctlyof his frieud's
warlilre aciriercmcnts. It is possible thatVarus had tehen part in the German war of
38 B.c.-11. M] The confession in v. 3οι a youthful anrbitiou to write ou heroic
subjecte is apparently genuine. It is supported hy the story iu Suetonius· biography
that Virgil wished to write ou Romen history, but was deterred by the subject. This
aspiration may be said ιο have been afterwards tulillled in the deuehi: but the
poet's judgmeut continued ιο shrinlr from the ιιιιι οι direotly recording oon·
temporary victorias, though, lilrc Horace, he amused his patrous, sud perhaps ιιίιιι-
ιοιι, with the belief that he might be equal tc it some day.

The legend which follows maybeperslleled, if ιιοι tracedto its source. AsKeight·
ley suggests, the first hiut was perhaps given hy the story iu the fourth book of tha
Odyssey, of Menelaus binding Proteus, afterwards imitated more directly by Virgll
himself in G. 4. Servius refers to a tale told by Theopompus (the historiari, seeDict·
Biog.) aud partially cited from him by helian (Ver. Hist. 3. 18), thet Silenus was
found drunlr by some shepherds of Phrygia, bound, aud carried to Midas, when his
chains fell off, aud he answcred thc king’s questions “de rebus naturalibus ct anti·
quie.'' ovid (M. ιι. 99 ιυιι.) briedy mentions the fact of the capture, but says nothing
about any disclcsures by Silenus, whom hildes restores to Bacchus, aud receives iu
return the fatal gift of turning things to gold.

'l'hc subject of the song was perhaps traditionally connected with Silenus, who, like
Proteus in G. 4 (v. 393 note), seems to have hod a memory for the past as well ιι an
eye ior the future—a characteristic asold aa the Homerio prophete and poete, sud
involved in the legend which makes the Muses daughters of Mnemosyne. The coe·
mogouical purtof it is indicative of thatyearningat'ter philosophye· s poot's province,
which is tired on Virgil bytho testimony, not ouly of Suetonius, but of his own
worlrs, especially the close of G. 2: sud was euoournged doubtless hythe re⁶ent ex·
ample of Lucretius, as well as by the more ancient precedente of the legendary philo·
sopher-poete aud historicsl poet-philosophans cf Greeoe (see also note on vv. ιιι-49
cf this Eulogue). The general stratu of the song ιι parallel to that of Orid'a
Metamorphoses, aud suggests the conjecture that Virgil may have been directly
indehted to some such work ns the ‘Ereperodpeva of Nicander, from which the poeni
of ovid is supposed to have been imitated.
