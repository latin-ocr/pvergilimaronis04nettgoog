146 GEORGIOA.

Lucretius himself alhs of Epicurus, Empedocles, and Anaxagoras. I
mean those celebrated lines towards the close of the Second ΒοοΙι,6
where the poet prays first oi all that the charming Muses, whose
minister hc is lor the great love that has emitten him, would admit
him of their company, and teach him the courses ot the stars iu heaven,
the various eclipses of the sun, and the agonias of the moon, whence
corne quakings oi the earth, what is the force by which the deep sess
swell to the bursting of their harriers and settle down again cathem·
salves, why the winter suns make such haste to dip in ocean, or what
istheretarding cause which makes the nights move slowly;-and then,
alter adverting to the humbler plcasures ol a country liic, commemoratas
the happiness of theman who has gained a knowledge of the causes oi
things, and so trampled underfoot all leurs, and fete's relentless decise,
aad the roar of insatiata Acheron. It is in Lucretius' poem that
eclipses, carthquakes, and the varying lengths ol days iu winter and
summer, are discussed and accounted for: it is Lucretius himself who
dilates on the beatific vision disclosed to the follower oi the Epicurean
system, when the terrers of the mind fiee away, aud the walls of the
universe part asunder, and the mansione of the gods appear in calm,
nnclonded light, bulthe realms ol Acheron are no more seen. Besidee
this direct recognition, the number of imitatione of Lucretius contained
in the Georgica is very great. ldveu Forbiger‚ who had edited Im·
cretius before he uudertook Virgil, though he has gethered a copious
harvest, has leit some for a casual reader to glean: and Ι cannot doubt
that au attentivc student ot Lucretius, who could perceire less obvious
resemblances, would be able to collect many more. The invocation oi
Venusia perhaps rather to be contrasted than compared with the briefer
addresses to the different rural gods which open the Fimt Book of the
Georgica, but it seems tohave supplied a hint for the invocationes
Bacchus which stands at the head of the Second, while Memmius,
allowance being madefor the greater diffuseness in which Lucretius
throughout indulges, stands in nearly the same relation to the one poem
as Maecenas to the other. The narrative oi the plagae of Atheus, with
which Lucretius concludes his poem, was obviously the model ot the
account ot the pestilence in Northern Italy at the end of Virgil’s Third
Book. Nor, while we remark a general similarity in the structure of
the paragrapho in which the strictly didactic portion oi the two poema
is contained, need we pass over the fact that Virgil is indebted to
Lucretius for several ol the formulae with which he introduces these
divisione ol his subject—for the ‘ Principio,’ ior the ‘ Praeterea,’ ior the
‘Nunc sge‚' ior the ‘Quod superesl,’ and lor the ‘Gontcmplatou'
