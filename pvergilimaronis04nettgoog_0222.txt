Μ. Id quidem ego et tacitus, Lycida, mecum ipse voluta,
Si valeam meminisse3 neque 005 ignobile carmen.

“ Huc ades, 0 Galatea3 quis aetnam ludus in undis?

Hic ver purpureum, varios hic fiumina circum 40
Fundit humus fiores, hic eandida populus antro

Imminet, et lentae texunt umbracula vitee;

Huc ades3 insani feriant eine litora fluctus.’'

L. Quid, quae te pura solum sub nocte canentem
Audieram? numeros memini, si verba tenerem. 4⁵
