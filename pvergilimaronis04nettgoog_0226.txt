BUCOLIGA. SOL. IX. 109

sommentary attributed to Probus, which in thia part seems to ba maed ou tha same
sonroes oi information aa the biography by Suetonius, informs us that Virgil had his
astate restored on being introduced to Octavianus by Cornelius Gallus3 thet the
veterana were so imitated at thiatbat the poet was nearly killed by the primipilaris
Millonius Toto: that the Eelogues were not published in the order in whioh they were
written. for the ninth,aoomplaint of injury, ought to be plaoed before the first, whioh
isan expression of gratitudo for the redress oi the injury. Thus Probus, or the oom-
piler of the oommentary attributed to him, regarded the first Eelogue as referring
‘othe ilnal restoration of Virgil to his eatam, subsequent to tlre aet of violenos of whioh
eomplaint ia made in the ninth.

But Servius, in his commentary on the first Ilelogue, says, in explaining the
relation of the ninth Itologua to the first, that, after the first Eologue was written,
Virgil went baolr to hia estate, was then almost killed (not by Millonius Τοιο but)
by ons Arrius, saved himself by leaping into tha Minoia, and afterwards uad his estate
again restored by Oetavianus. Servius plaees the ninth Eologne efter the first, and
ao do ‘⁴ others” (olii) whom he quotes, who however give quita adiil'erent aooount of
the transaetion. Aooording to them Virgil, after obtaining immunitos oporam from
Octavianus, fell into a disputa with a neighbour about his boundsries; aman named
clodius threatened to kill him, and puraued him with a drawn sword, but Virgil
eaoaped into a oharooalburner’a shop.

I doubt whether it is worth while attemptiug, aa Ribbeck does in his Prolepooseaa,
to weave these different aoooums into a oonsistent whole. It is olear that, as ia
natural in auoh aenae, different versione of the transaotion must have existed in the
time of Servius, and very probably muoh earlier. The main question, however, ia,

what does the bestevidenoe, that of the Eologuos themselves, warrant us in inferring?
The oommentators were evidently aomewhat puazled by the faoi of the ninth Erlogue

ooming after the first. The difficulty is notioed by Probus, who aeeounts for it in
a rational way: but Ι anapeot that Servius and the authorities whom he quotes
were misled by the order in whieh the Eologues standand arranged the faots so aa to
put tha ninth chronologionlly subsequent to the first. I believe that Probus (if it ba
Probus) was right in supposing the ninth to have been the earliest, and the flrat to
refer to the final restoration of Virgil’s estate. This supposition is not contradioted
by the mention of Varus in the ninth Eologue, supposiug him. ae we must suppose,
to be tha Alfenus Varus who had sueoeeded Pollio in Cisalpine Gaul. For Suetonius
expresaly says that it was this Varus, with Asinius Pollio and Gallus, whose influenee
moured to Virgil theposseasionof his estate. ln other worda, the entreaties sddressed
to Varus in the ninth Felogue were snoeemful, Varus not earing to pursue his
politieel differenoes with Pollio so far aa to injure Polliofs friend.

I doubt then whether the evidenoe adorded by the Euloguee themselves and by the
biography of Suetonius (and the other evidsnoe we have seen to be oonfussd and in·
oonsistent) warrants our assuming more than this: that Virgil was ejeeted with
violenoe aud at the peril of hia life from hia farm, ester having been under the
impression that he was to keep it; thatin his trouble hs was assisted by Mneoenas
(Suetoniua,§ 20); that he addressed Alfenus Varus on the subjeot in theninth
Eulogue, and probably also in plain prose: that he then went to Rome, where, baolred
by the intluenoe of Pollio, Varus, and Gallus (to whom the eighth, ninth, arrd tenth

hFeloguegse are {⁸13⁰}th dedicated), he obtained from Oemvianua the restoration of
