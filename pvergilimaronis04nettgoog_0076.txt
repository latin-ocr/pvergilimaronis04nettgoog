presumably, in the libri datii commate), as well as in Caper and
Probus.

After a digression on active words used passively (p. 393-396), the
alphabetical list interrupted ou p. 392 is resumed at the word mmwro,
and we have a list from m tu a (muniere-utor), ιο which are finally
added a lew more words (mercatore, praesepio, and opino).

Compar-ing the lists given ou pp. 392-ss and 396 with the former
lists (pp. svs-387), it is impossible not to come to the conclusion that
they are derived (the first at second-haud) from two independent works
treating oi the same subject. Were the two lists supplementary to
each other, did each confine itself to words which the other omitted,
it would oi course be natural to argue that both came from thesaure
trestise. But this is not the case. The second list contains a cou-
sidcrable number oi words already included in the first; a sure sign
that Priscian is using two distinct works, each oi which had its own
list, though the catalognes ιο some extent covered the same ground.

Priscian mentions three writers as his authorities, Pliny, Probus,
and Caper: “eorum et superiorum omnium usus tam apud Captum
quarn Plinium et Probum iuvenies ”—“quorum auctores apud Capram
legant qui sce scire desiderant.” In some way or other, theu, we must
suppose that the honour of these lists must be divided between these
three writers, or rather, between Pliny and Probus.

Iret us now compare the lists of Priscian with that iu the seventh
book ol Nonius.

A large number oi words are common to the lists of Nouius aud
Priscian: between sixty and seveuty, ii l am not wrong, out of a
hundred or rather more. 'Phe majority oi the instances iu Nonius
coincides with the second list iu Priscian: the others correspond mostly
with the first, but in some cases with notes in other parts ol Priscian.

This general coincidence would naturally lead us to infer a common
origin forthe lists of Nouius and Prisciau; aud there are minor iudiea-
tions which point in the same direction. A few of Nonius’ instances
are ιο be found in Quintilian: this is the ease with the notes ou
adsentio. p. 469, punior aud fabricer, p. 471, and luxurior, p. 481. forms
which ere commented ou by Quintilian, 9. 3. 6. Oi some other notes
in this part of Nonius, we know that they are due ιο Caper, that is, in
all probability, to Probus: thiais the case with the note ou poenitebunt,
p. 475 (see Prisc. 1, p. 561), copulantur, p. 476 (Prisc. 1, p. 393),
adiciatur, p. 477 (Prisc. 1, p. 391). The note on cupere, p· 469, may
beve been due to Pliny, for Servius, on A. 7. 273, quotes a note from
Pliny distinguishiug between euporo and auguror.

So far ae these indicatione go, they seem to warraut the conclusion
to which the general resemblance between Nonius and Priscian has
