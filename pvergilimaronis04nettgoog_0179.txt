Extinctum Nymphae crudeli funere Daphnim ao

Flebant3 vos coryli testes et flumina N ymphis3

Cum complexa sui eorpus miserabile nati

Atque deos atque astra vocat crudelia mater.

Non ulli pastos illis egere diebus

Frigida, Daphni, boves ad flumina3 nulla nec amnem 25

Libavit quadrupes nec graminis attigit herbam.

Daphni, tuum Poenos etiam ingemuisse leones

Interitum montesque feri silvaeque locuntur.
