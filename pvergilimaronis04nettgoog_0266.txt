received the endowment cf delicacyand artistic skill from the Muses of
the oonntry; and the sentence which, in the mouth of its author, was
merely the expression of a fact, has been accepted and repeated in later
times aethe announcement of a judgment. Now that Virgil has ceased
ιο be regarded as the rival of Homer, it is common to represent him as
the poet of rural life, who is to be estimated not by the ambitione ask
which imperial vanity thrust npon his manhood, but by the more simple
and geuial werke to which he turned oihimself in the freshnessof youth.
Such is tha view which is enforced by Mr. Keble in his Lectores en
Poetry.¹ 'l'hat which especially distinguishes virgil, it is cloquently
maintained,is his ardent and irrepressible lore of the country. Not
only is it the animating sonl cf the Eclogues aud Georgius, hut it hanuts
him throughout the Aeneid‚ venting itself in a number of half-melan·
chely retrospecta, and breaking ont into “a thousand similes.” He
seems scarcely to wish tc make his hero interesting, but he is never
tired of illustrating cpio situations by the characteristic beauties and
delicate proprieties of natural objecta. Nay, it is evan suggested that
the aventin his personal history which most markedly connects him
with the country, is likelyto have had a large share in determining the
character of his poetry. Anxiety about the safety of his farm was oue
of the presiding feelings in the composition of the Eclogues: the tender
recollection of the past danger and ef the scenas which he may have
afterwards revisited hovers over the Georgica z gratitudo for the pro·
tection extended to him induced him ιο make a sacrifice el his trner
mstincm, and undertake the Aeneid.

'l'o attempt a full discussion of this opinion would he obviously pre·
sumptnons iu one who is consciens cf his own deficiency in the power or
habit of appreciating externa] nature, and so is incapable of rightly
estimating those descriptiva or alluaive toncbes which undoubtedly ap-
pear throughout Virgil’s poems. Such a one, however, may perhaps
be allowed ιο state his own imrenion with regard ιο the prominence of
the position which the feeling iu question would seem ιο have occupied
inthepoet's mindae unfolded iubis works. 'I'he choica of a subject
certainly furnishee a primd faeie argument that the subject, or some-
thing connected with it, has been thought congenial hy the chooser,
though we must not forgct that Virgil himself speaks of kings and
battles ashaving baeu the object of his first poetical aspiratione, referring,
so tradition interprete the passage, to an abandoned intention of cele-
brating the ‘ Albani patres,’ theroyal line from which Romcwas derived.
