VIRGIL AND HIS ANOIENT aululae. xxxv

etiam Iatinam etymologiam,” 10. Hyginus (ap. Gall. 7. 6) blamed
the phrase praepetibus pennu, which was defended by parallele from
Ennius and Matius. Gellius 10. 29. 4 says that in G. 1. 203 atqcue was
thought obscure, and interprete it ee = statim so Nonius, p. 530. 'Phe
phrase tunicam squalentem aare was again defended by ancient example

(Gellius 2. 6. 19). Servius on A. 12. 517 (Dan.) says 01 eccere in
that line “quaeritur eane quie primus 0000001 pro peroso dixerit.”

From these criticisms, which attribute 10 Virgil the invention oi
new words, or a new or rare application 01 old ones, we should be
careiul to separate such remarks 00 that of Cornutus on 000010
(Gellius 2. 6=Maerobiue 6. 7. 4) “ incuriose et abiecte in his versibus
verbum poeuit; ” on inlaudati Busiridis: “ hoo enim verbum inlaudati
000 eet idoneum ad exprimendam sceleratissimi hominis detesta-
tionem ; ‘’ and that quoted from the same writer 00 the words (1100101
aa aliquid amparare by Servius 00 Aen. 10. 547, “Cornutus 01 sor-
didam improbat.”

'Phe 00100 01 Gellius and Macrobius on ceam and 1110010100, 11
should be observed, throw fresh light 00 the relation of the 8001100 oi
the Saturnalia 10 the real Servius, who has the remark 00 uacare
(11016. 75 ⁴) in a shorter form, and without any mention of objections3
while 10 his note 00 inlaudatus (Georg. 3. 4) he takes no seaeant of
the discussion carded on 10 Gelbes and Macrobius, but simply ex·
plaiae the word as=qai laudari 000 debeat. With these criticisms
compare Servius 00 Aen. 8. 731, “hunc versum 001001 critici qussi
superfluo 01 inutiliter additum, nec convenientem gravitati eins,
namque est magis neoterioue;” Aen. 11. 53, “hoc quidam ἀνέκδοτον
(10000601) 01 vulgare accipiunt3 sed decenter ad exprimendum patris
adlectum nnnc ad patrem redit.”

III.

I now corne to consider some oi the criticisms made upon Virgil’s
management 01 his story in the Aeneid Macrobius l. 24 2 speaks
01 “ multa pudenda . . . in dispositione operis.”

In the Ars Poetica (143 foll.) Horace lays down the principle that

the Homeris order 01 narrative (as distinguished, for instance, we may
suppose hini 10 mean, from that 01 Apollonius Rhodius) is that which

un cpio poet ought 10 followz
“Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dere lucem
Cogitet, ut speciosa dehine miracula promat,
