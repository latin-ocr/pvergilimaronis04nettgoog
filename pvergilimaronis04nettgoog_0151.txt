32 P. VERGILI MARONIS

ECLOGA· H.
ALEXIS.

A sumansu gives atteranoe ιο his love for a beautiful youth, oomplainlng of his in-
differentes, urging him to eome and live with him iu the oountry, and finally up·
braiding himself for his infatuation.

Parta of this Ealogue are closely modelled after the eleventh Idyl of Theocritus,
where the Cyclops addresses Calates in o similar manner. We should be glad to
’ believe it to he purely imagtnrwy, though oven then lt ie suffioieutly degrediug to
Virgil Suetonius, however, and Servius, have'a story, also referred ιο by Martiol
(8. 56, lto.) und Apuleius (Apol. p. 279, ed. Elmenhoret)‚ that Alexis isintended for
Alexander, a youth belonging to Pollio (hlartial says Musaeum, who ean hardly
have been then eoquaiuted with the poet), sud given by him to Virgil, who is
supposed by Spohn to have written the Eologue ae a mark of gratitudo to his patron.

Corydon and Alexis are probably fellowelaves, though it is not easy to reeonoile
the various passages whioh seem to refer ιο Corydon’s eondition (vv. 2, 20-22, 57),
and ιι ie possible that Virgil may not have settled the point in his own mind,
Corydon being in faut a mixture of the ordinary Theocritean shepherd and the
Cyelops. ,

The beeehes (v. 3) and mountains (v. 5) again point to Sioily, not to Mantua und
Sicily is expressly mentioned in v. 21.

This Eologuo is generally supposed to have been the first written; but, oe
Keightloy remarks, all that ean be asserted is, that it was earlier than tha llfth, and
' perhaps thau the third (see Eol. 5. 86, 87).
