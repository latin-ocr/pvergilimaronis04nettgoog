THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. oi

, meamus susumus nouarus.

The commentary of Tiberius Claudius Donatus ou the Aeneid,
written towards the end of the fourth century nu. for the benetit of
his son Tiberius Claudius Maximus Donatianns, differs in its scope
aud aim from notes such as those of the Verona scholia, Servius, or
Philargyrius. This writer's main objectis ιο bring out fully the
meaning of his author by writing a lengthy paraphrase iu prose,
intended not only to explain the meaning of the poet, but to exhibit
the rhetorical connection of the clauses. For instance, on Aen. 1. 291
he takes paius ιο show that the words of Jupiter, “quin aspera Iuno
. . . Consilium in melius referet,” are meantes a consolatory reply to
the complaint of Venus “ unius ob iram Prodimnr.’' The commentator
aims always at explaining the connection of ideas, and showing
generally how Virgil's arrangement and the development of his
narrative coincide with the fitness of things. Elementary points of
mythology are noticed iu this commentary, but, so far as I have
observcd, there is very little information on grammar and antiqnities.

A modern reader will probably find the vvork of Tiberius Donatus dull
aud unprofitable to a degree quite unusual in the case oi any commentary
on a secular author. But his own professions with regard to it are
interesting as throwing some light on the condition of scholarship and
education in the fourth century an. He says in his preface² that he
intends his remarks to be mainly educational. The schoolmastcrs
give their scholare nothing oi any valne, while the commentatore,
writing for the purpose not oi instruction bnt of research, however
praisevvorthy their acal, have leit their remarks in a comparatively
inaccessible condition. He begs his son to compare bis work with
that of the older commentatore, and to jndge for himself what he
prefers to follow in the one or the other.

This commentary was, according to its author's own statement,⁸
