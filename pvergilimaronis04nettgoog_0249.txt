INTRODUOTION.

Tus student 01 Virgil may be said to enjoya singular advantage in the

preservation of those works 01 Greek poetry which his author professes
to have imitated. A few fragments are all that is 1011 01 1101 glorious
body 01 lyric song which, aiter having been the delight 01 Graece, while

Graece was yet a aetion, lived again at Rome 10 110 Odes 01 Horace, η

inspiriug their spirit and dictating their matre. Still more scantyis
our knowledge 01 110 poema which are supposed to have served as
models for Ovid’e Metamorphoses, such as the Hesiodio 'Hohw1 or the
Ἐτεροιούμενα 01 Nicander. Not only may vve suppose that we have lost
the key to many thoughts, imagee, aud phrases, which the possession 01
110 Greek would have euabled us 10 clear up, but the whole relation 01
110 Latin poems to their originale becomes 0 matter 01 1010το000 and
01 vagus conjecture. But 10 possessing Theocritus, Hesiod, and Homer,
we may feel that vve possess, ae it vvere, the exciting causes 01 110
Eclogues, the Georgica, aud the Aeneid. They do not indeed represent
all the literavy iufiusnoes which must have told upon Virgil’s genius,
or disclose 10 00 110 origin 01 110 000011οιΙ manner in which 10 has
conducted the work 01 imitation: but they show us what it was that
in each successive case first stimulated his general conception 01 110
subject—what it was that he admired in the literature 01 Greece, and
sought to reproduoe among bie own countryrnen: they enable us 10
y'udge 01 him not only 00 0 poet, but as a critic 01 110 poetry 01 others.

With segurd 10 Hesiod, indeed, there is considerable reason to doubt
whether we possess the whole 01 what Virgil set himself to copy.
Varioas agricultural precepta are cited from Hesiod-lor instance,
about the culture 01 110 olive aud 110 vine—which liud uo place iu the
Works and Daye, as we now read 110ος and though some 01 these
may be disposed ol by the consideration that the name 01 Hesiod was
often loosely applied 10 any thing which might fall under the head 01
ruval didactics, enough remeius 01 0 more strictly Hesiodio character

to render some other hypothesis necessary-whether it be the popular
German theory that the extant Works and Daye, interpolated 00 110
same authority pronounoes them to be, represent only apert 01 110
