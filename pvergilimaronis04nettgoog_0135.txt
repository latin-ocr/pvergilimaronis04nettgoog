parallel, where pines and springs call for the absent Tityrus, and where
mountain and vineyard shout in the ears of Menalcas the apotheosis of

Daphnis. The former, properly understood, seems to be a pieoe of
gracefrss raillery, remiuding the gardener that while he was away his
trees were undressed, end the boare, perhaps, wallowing in his springs.
Tha latter has a grandenr about it recalling the sublimity of Jewish
prophecy, at the same time that we are apparently intended to think
not only of nature endowed with human feeling, but of actual human
Δ joy, tha joy of the traveller on the mountain and of the vine-dresser

under the rock. Even the epithet intonsi nwntea would seem ιο have
a double reference: in one of its aspecta it suggests tho notion of a
pathless wild, aud thus brings out the aniversality of the rejoicing: in
another it makes ιιι feel with nature ss it were against man, representing
the mountains as glorying in that strength which nature gave and the
reign of Daphnis will secure to them, as the fir-trees and cedars in
lsaiah exult over the king of Babylon, “ Since thou art laid down, no
ieller is'coma up against us.” So the same changes in the order of
nature are named at one time among the glories of the coming golden
age, at another as effecte oi a general curse, which is to transfer the
rights of the strong and beautiful ιο the wcak and contemptible. Under
the reign of Daphnis the wolf is to spara the sheep: in the youth of the
new-born raler oi the earth the oak is to distil honey: Pollio and his
admirarere to dwell in a dream-land where spicas grow ou tha bramble:
yet it is in images like these that Damon hurls his dying scorn at the
world where hs has been robbed of his love. What can be more signifi-
cant than the apparently casual epithet arguto, applied in the very first
line of the seventh Eclogne to the trec under which Corydon and Thyrsis
are about to sing? ι Or let ns take the passage which serves as a oom-
ment on that epithet, the lines ou Maenalus in Damon’s song. Lucre-
tius,⁸ in his account of the origin of society and civiliaation, tells us that
pastoral music must have been in the first instance an imitation of the
sound of the wind among the reeds: but the thought gains indefinitely
when itis localizcd and transferred to Maenmus, “whose foresta are ever
tunefnl and his pines ever vocal, who is ever listening to the loves of
shepherds, and ιο Pan, the first who would not have the reeds left nn-
employed.” 'lhe personification of the mountain gives both definiteness
and majesty to the conception: the very fact that the connexion between
vocal woods and shepherds’ songs is hinted rather than expressed is an
advantage even philosophically: and the mention of Pan supplies that
mythological framework to which the theories of the ancients on the
history of man primeval owe so much, not only of beauty, but of sub·
