362 Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

Longius, ant credunt caelo adventantibus Euris;

Sed circum tutae sub moenibus urbis aquantur,
Excursusque brevis temptant, et saepe lapillos,

Ut cumbae instabiles fluctu iactante saburram 195
Tollunt, his sese per inania nubila librant

Illum adeo placuisse apibus mirabere morem,

Quod neque concubitu indulgent, nec corpora segnes

In Venerem solvunt, sut fetus nixibus edunt;

Verum ipsae e foliis natos et suavibus herbis aco
Ore legunt, ipsae regem parvosque Quirites

Sufficiunt, aulasque et cerea regns relingunt.
