88 P. VERGILI MARONIS

'l'he Eclogue itseli is so iar parallel ιο Ε. 5 that it contains a species ol nmoehean,
consisting not, like Ilolognos 3 and 7, oi a number ol short efforts, but ol two cou-
tinuous strains of equid lengths-the diil'erenoe between o dialogus and aret oration
followed bya set reply—snsgested perhaps by Theoor. Id. 9, where there cre two
songsoi seven lines each. But the domii here is much more complicandam oi
the poenm being composed ol ten stanneo (so to oali them), consisting respectively ol
two, three, tour, and live lines, ond separated from each other hya burden. The
arrangement ol the stannes however is not quite the same in the two poetas, as the last
three stannus oi Damou’s song consist respectively ol four, five, and three lines with
their burricus, while in Alphesiboens' the order oi the concluding stannes runs, five
lines, three lines, and tour lines.

The circumstances under which this amoebean exercite takes place are not stated
(note on v. lt). The two songs hane no formal connexion, though baffled lovels the
meme oi both. The ilrst is imitated from various passages in the first, third, end
eleventh Idyls oi Theocritus, the seoond entirely from Idyl 2, which virgil abridges
ond flts with a more prosperons conclusion.
