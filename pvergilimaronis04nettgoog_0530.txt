ΟΝ THE LATER DIDAOTIG POETS OF ROME. 411

Remsey, to whose article in the Dictionery oi Biography those who are
desirous of further informetion may be profitably referred, reconoiles
these apparently conflicting 10010 by supposing that the poem, bearing,
ae it does, merke of incomplcteuess, may never have 11000 publishcd,
bnt that a copy or two may have got into private circulation, aud so
may have been accidentally preserved. Ι do not pretend to hare given
the work such en examination 00 would quality me to form au inde-
pendent opinion 3 nor would Irenture to decide whether, as some have
supposed, his laugusge would not lead ns to believe him to have boen
a foreiguer. The work is apparently written with that average com·
maudei the hexameter which, aiter tho example set by Virgil, became
almost a matter oi course ior a Roman poet, and the languagc has
much of that elaboration and point which after the Augustae ege was
exacted as a necessity, while it almost ceaeed to be a merit: but there
is no genuino energy or iclicity oi diction: the expressions are frc-
quently forced, eud the thoughts, where not obvious, ere apt to
degenerate into conceits. Ipropose to justify this character of a poem
which numbers the younger Scaliger and Bentley among its editors,
and Oreech, nottho worst versifier of Dryden’s contemporaries, among
its translatore, by a iew extrects from tha more professedly poetical
passages, end afterwards to give some notion oi the general mode oi
treatment by an analysis 01 the First Book.

Eech citha five books is introduced hya long exordium, in which
the author was evidently anxious to display his powers 00 0 poet. The
first hook has an introductiou of 117 lines, the second of at least 59,
tho third 0142, the fourth of 121, the fifth oi 29: and similar halting-
places are fnrnished by the conclusione of the first and third books·
In the opening of the second book Manilius elaboratos the same

thought which 10 euforced by Virgil at the beginning oi the Third
Georgic, the difficulty oi finding a subject which had not beau
exhausted by previous treatment: bnt it is easy to sce hovv far the
rhetorician is removed from tho poet. After speaking oi Homer in
lines oi which the text is too uncertain to make them worth quoting,
he comcs to Hesiod
