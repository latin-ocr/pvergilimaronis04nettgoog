INTRODUOTION. 135

gethers itself, parts of it, it is true, being connected with him some-
what loosely, hut never absolutely detaehing themselves from him.
Hesiod iuvolres the Muses, but it is that they may tell him of Zeus,

and induce the great Father to see that human justice is rightly
awarded, while he himself speaks ιο Perses the words of truth. Perses
is uo Maecenas, who, though he may have suggested the subject of the
song, is addressed iu it merely as a sort of ideal reader: he is a wrong·
doer in whose mind a change has to be wrought, for his own sake and
for the sake of others, aud legend, feble, and preceptore employed by
turus to bring him ιο a seusa of past miscenduot sud present duty.
'l'he subject is introduced, as it were, by a fresh leaf out of tha Theo·
gony, in which, however, the mythologicsl element is subordinated to
the moral, a description of two goddesses of strife, whom we mey dis·
tinguish in modern language as Discord aud Emulation, the first the
source of war and misery, the second of honourable endeavour. But
the moral is for Perses, who is warned not ιο waste time which a busy
mou can ill sparo on the folse etrife, forensis wraugling, but to have
the question of his own and his brother's inheritauce settled by im-
partial arbiters, not, as at the last trial of the suit, by judges whom he
had bribed. For him, too, is told the legend of Prometheus and Zeus,
showing how Pandora first brought evil among mankind, who had lived
till then uutroubled by hard toil aud grievous sickness, and concluding
thence that there is no way of escape from the eye of Zeus. That tale
being over, Perses is celred if he will hear another, aud biddeu ιο lay
it up deep in his beart. Then follows the narrative of the five ages, in
the last of which men are now living, an evil time, when father shall
be at variauce with child, guest with host, friend with friend, and
brother with brother; when justice and conscience shall not be found
iu the hands of men, but the base shall supplsnt the more noble, speak-
iug crooked words, and shall swear s false oath. One more taleis
told, a very brief one, addressed to kings and judges of the earth. It
cousists simply of o reply by a hawk to a uightiugale struggling iu his
talons, aud appealiug for marey, a reply which amouuts to no more
than that she is absolutely at his disposal and had better not resist;
the intention doubtless being ιο put the case of oppression iu all its
nahed repulsiveuess, that homan pervertere of justice mey understand
and pause in their wrougful course. Passing from feble ιο a more
direct mode of appeal, he again exhorts both Perses and the judges.
'Phe former is biddeu to “look ou this picture aud ou this ; ” on the
flourishing city of the just, where there ore pesce and festal doings,
where the oak carries acorna at ite top and honey at its core, where the
children resemble their parents, aod none go ou shipboard, for earth
produces fruit enough; aud on the unjust nawen, which is over wasted
