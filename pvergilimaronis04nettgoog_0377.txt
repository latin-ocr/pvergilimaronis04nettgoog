P. VERGILI MARONIS

Ipsa acie nondum lalcis temptanda, sed uncis eat

carpendae manibus frondes, interque legendae.

Inde ubi iem validis amplexae stirpibus ulmos

exierint, turn stringe comas, tum bracchia tonde;

Ante reformidant ferrumj tum denique dura

Exerce imperia et ramos compesce fluentes. 370
Texendae saepes etiam et pecus omne tenendum,

Praecipue dum frons tenera imprudensque laborum;

Cui super indignas hiemes solemque potentem
