Without quoting all the instances 11 11111 retirement in langue
given 11 Macrobius, we are,I think, justified iu asserting that th
were 1 number 11 expressions in Virgil which were felt 11 reqr
defense or explanation. That Macrobius had iu his hands some w«
11 works in which they were attached, or, at least, remarked up
may be iuterred from two facts. First, it will 11 observati that in
11111111111 11111111 above quoted, he seems 1ο 11 giving the act
words 11 11 adversary: I mean those 11 Aen. 11111114..
(here the words 111 now mutilated), aud 10. 716. Secondly,
criticisms fall roughly under heads, though Macrobius does not say
Bessus ccede, caeso sanguineam instances olan nncommon 111
adjectivcs; sota 111111, consortem uati, mille 1111111111 arcam, ecaicr
ipat, of an uncommou 111 11 cases: tela ecit, 11 11 nncommon 11
11111. The instances which follow are 1111111 metaphora : 1111
tramissa, 1111111 antro, frontem arat, aerato circumfert tegmine silvam
precis, aquae morra, telorum sepes, ferrera imber. 'lhen comes a men
11 some expressions not easily reduceable under any particular hcai
Dona laboratae Cereris: and, finally, a 111111 Virgil's use 11 111 1
111 another, ss ora 111 personas.

Supposing the whole passage to be au extract from some colle<
11 such expressions, these two facts will be easily explained. A ι
parison 11 111 notes given in parallel columns will, I think, show
the Servius 11 111 Saturnalia stands 11 11 1111111111 dependens
the real Servius. The real Servius is sometimes silent where Macra
has 1 1111; sometimes he is fuller, sometimes less full than Macrol
sometimes he seems 11 11 defending Virgil against an objection 3 a«
times his remark adds something new, or is altogether different.
the 11111 time, the same passages are, on the whole, commentcd ι
both; and this 1111, when pnt together with that 11 111 discrepa
just noticed, points to 111 conclusion that both 111 ultimately dc:
from the same source.

To this source, whatever it was, we may, perhaps, owe the 11111
notes in the commentary bearing the name 11 Servius 2—Aen. 1
