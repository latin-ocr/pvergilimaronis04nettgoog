THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. ciii

with those of the anonymcns commentary on the Georgica. The argn-
ment is not conclusive, for it assumes on the one hand that Iunilius
Flagrus is a corruption of the name Iunius Philargyrius, end on the
other that the coincidence of the notes attributed to Flagrns in the Berne
scholia with those which have hitherto been assigned to Philargyrins
proves nnity of authorsbip, whereas it need prove nemore than nnity
of origin. Still the facts alleged tend to establish a probability, which
· I think justifies ns in still quoting the notes in question under the
name of Philargyrius.

'l'he commentary itsclf isa good one, based on excellent sources, and
quite worthy to rank with that cf Servius. The date oi its compilation
is quite uncertain· but judging from its general style and tone, Ishculd
be disposed tot thirik that it could nothe placed later than the fourth
century aa. 'Pharo' rs no mention' m it eitherof Donat tus oroi Servius3

but it might be rash to inter anything from this fact. It 1s also true
that Servius ,though he mentions Donatus ,says nothing of Philargyrius.
Doce this provo that Philargyrius was his contemporary, or that he

hvl'hdaditindmentanes oi Servius and of Philargyrius on the Georgica

are independent of each other; but there is plenty of evidence to show
that for all that constitutos, so to speak, tha backbone ci their work,
for their grammar, lexicography, history, and antiquities, they are
alike dependent on the stores oi information gathcred by the scholare
of the first and the beginning of the second centurias. This could be

easily shown by a comparisou oi their notes in detail with notes in
Festus, N onius, Gellius, and the grammarians, such as that of which I

have attempted to give a specimen in the preceding sections.

SERVIUS.

The name of this commentator is given in all MSS. earlier than the
fifteenth century simply as Servius; and Priscian in quoting his werke
knows of uo praenomen or cognomen.⁶ 'Phe name Maurus Servius
Honoratus is highly suspicions, occurring as it does only in fifteenth
century manuscripts. A note of the pseudo-Acron on Horace, Sat. 1.
9. 76, mentions a “ Servius, magister Urbis,’' as offering an ex·
planation ol the word destestari. Whetherwe have any right to identify

this person with our Servius is extremely doubtful.
Servius is introduced as oue of the interlocutors in the Saturnalia

On G. 4. 89, the note ol mma is different hom that of Philargyrius, aad on

G. t 565 they are independent
Aa a rule, the notes in the Berua scholia give a short abshact of those in tha
Philargyrian commentary, though this is not always the case
