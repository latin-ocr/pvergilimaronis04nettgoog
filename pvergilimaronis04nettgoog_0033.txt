xxx . VIRGIL AND HIS ANGIENT ORITIOS.

has reeently argued, may very probably have been written when Virgil
was alive-
“ ln verbis etiam tesan consque mendic,
Hoc emet, hoo spernat promissi carminis aucmr:
Diserta egregie, snum si collido urbam
Redditis-it taratara nouum.”

Horace asserts thet new combinations of ordinary words, if madi
with nieety and cantion (tenutis mutusque), are to be put down toa poet'r
credit. Now in the whole context of this passage (to which I shal'
have to return again) Horace is delending himself and his schoo
against the attacks of hostile criticism3 and it is therefore very probabh
that his remarks about new combinations ol words may be intended a
a covent reply to such charges as that brought by Agrippa.

Herennius, says Suetonius, made a collection ol Virgil's uitio
Vitium would, Ι suppose, mean any fault in style or expressior
Quintilian says of κακοζηλία (8. 3. 56), that it is emerium in depossiti
citiorum pessimum. Vitio, therefore, would include affectation real c
alleged, and we can hardly doubt that the work of Herennius include
instances of this. Perhaps it may also have included thevilla in uersibs
quae a nonnullis inperite reprehendantur mentioned byMaorobius 5. rs]
such alleged metrioal errors as arietat in portas, partetibus tectu·
meeis, duros obice postes, quin protinus omnia arbutus boando. Macri
bins goes on (ib. 5 5) to mention verses onlns oe raon similes at nili
differentes ab usn loquendi, ss omnio uincit Anwr, einos mansne Amor
Nudus insignata, Palinure, iacebis harena. These are defended by tl
example ol Homer: but tha words uulua ae rasis similes have all tl
air ol a quotation from a hostile critic. It mnst be remembered th
Macrobius’ Saturnalia is a mere successiones extracta fromolder worh
sometimes struug together in no logical order, and without anythii
to show where the transition from one writer to another is to be look
for. The only interest iu reading him is, therefore, that he makes
euricus to get back, il possible, to the sources on which he is drawit

In Macrobius 6. 6 Servius is represented as quoting some instant
ot new ligures, or combinatione of words, employed by virgil, “ Va·

itati leporis adiecit.” His instaures are Supposito de matre nob
