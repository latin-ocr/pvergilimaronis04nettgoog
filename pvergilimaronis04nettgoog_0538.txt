DIDAOTIO Porus OF ROME. 419

allowed to rsnlr higher than the elder in command oi poetical imagevy
end poetical lenguage: his work however is still more fragmentum,
being evidently only a part of what was originally intended, though
there are not the seme marks of actual imperfectior, end the number
oi suspected readings seems to be amaller in proportior. The thousend
ways oi hunting‚ the exhilareting toil‚ ond the repid evolutione of
possein rural striis, are Nemesianns’ subject; awholly new end nu·
tried oue, as he tells us, in apparent ignorance of the labours of his
predecessor. This boasted novelty he proceeds to enforce in the rhe-
torical spirit oi the passages which Ι quoted from Manilius, enumera·
tiug at great length by way oi contrast the venons subjecte which
other posta have treated to exhaustion. He then states his own in·
tentione more at large, and promises, like Virgil, atne distent day to
sing oi tlre exploits of his imperial patrona, the two sons of Carus.
Diana is then involred, aud invited to accoutre herself for the chase,
with pointed quivos, golden errove, purple buslrins, gold-embroidered
scari, jewelled belt, and wreath for the hsir; a eomewbat uuseasonable
inventory, imitated perhaps' irorn the werdrobe of a Homeric goddess,
but es frigid in au invocetion as it is appropriate in sn entique epic
narrative. After this introduction oi 100 lines we coms to the poem
itself‚ which takes up only 220 more. Neurly 140 of thess ere given
to dogs, the chief strecs being laid on the subject of training. Iwill
quote e few, which go over part of the ground traversed in the passage
cited from Gratius.

“Facundos aperit partus motura grevedo
Continuo, largaque vides strepere omnis prole:
Sed, quamvis avidus, primos mntemnere partus
Malueris mox non omnis nutrire minores
Nam tibi si placitum populosus poscere fetus,
Iam macie tonus sucique videbis insuis
Pugnantisque diu, quisnam prior ubera lambat,

Ι Distrabere invalidam lassato viscere matrem.
Sin vero haec curs est, melior ue lorte necetur
Abdaturvs domo, estrdosque probare voluntas

. Quale nondum gressus stabiles, neqm lumina passa ,
Luciferum videre iubar, quae prodidit usus
Percipe, et intrepidus spectatis adnue dictis.
Pondere nsm catuli puteris perpendere vires,
corporibusque levis gravibus praenoscere cursu
Quin et flammato dueatur linea louge
circuitu, signetque habilem vapor igneus orbern:

Huc omnes catuli, huc indiscrete teratur

Turba: dabit mater pertus eremius honestos,
Iudicio ustos servans trepidoque periclo.

Nam postquam conclusa videt sua germina mnne,
