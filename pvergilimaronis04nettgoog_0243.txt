126 ΟΝ THE LATER

Mycoo, the fifth Eulogue, is a kind of Georgia in a bucolic form.
The person who gives it its title, au old shepherd, takes the opportunity
of a mid-day sitting iu the shade to lecture a young pupil on the care
of sheep and geute, the times for grazing and milkiug, the cautious to

be observed in shearing, the remedius for wounded sheep, the best kind
of winter fodder, in a speech of 120 lines, rather closely studied after
the third Georgic of Virgil. ‚

A pastoral quarrel, loticiam, is the subject of the sixth Eclogue.
Lycidas is informed by Astilus that hohas just arrived too late for an

, amoebean contest between Nyctilus and Alcon, in which the latter has

been conqueror. Lycidas has a different opinion oi the prowees oi the
combatants, arraignstbe judgmeut, and challenges the judge. Acontest
is agreed on, Astilus wagering a stag, Lycidas a horse, aud Mnasyllos,
the umpire, bids them sing oi their respective loves. Buta taunt from
Lycidas musea his rival, and they appear to be coming to blows, when
they are stopped by Mnasyllos, who declines to have anything to do with
this physical enccunter, and ends au Eclogue, not uureasonably pro·
nonuced by Barth and Wernsdorf the most unsuccessiul of Calpurnius'
bucolic efforts.

In the seventh and lastEclogue, to which a transcriber has given the
not very appropriate title of Templum, the chief speaker is a shepherd,
uswly returned from town, and full of a show which he has seen in the
amphitheatre, where he has been particularly struck with the beauty oi
the buildiug and the variety of the wild beasts. He is congratulated on
being young when this glorious age is beginning, and questioned about
the personal appearance cf the imperial deity. The answer which he
gives is complimantary enough as far as it goes, but couveys little
information, and certainly forms rather an abrupt termination to an
Eclcgue assumed tc be the last of the series.

“0 utinam nobis non rustica vestis inesset l
Vidissem propius mea numina: sed mihi sordes,
Pullaque paupertas, et adunco fibula morsu
Obfuerunt. Utcumque tamen conspeximus ipsum
Longius, ac, nisi ma decepit deus, in uuo
Et Martis vultus et Apollinis esse putavi”

Nemesianus, who, if not Calpurnius, was certainly au imitator of
Calpurnius, makes hia first Ilclcgue a funeral poem ou Meliboeus, sn
exalted personage resembling the Meliboeus of his prototypa. Tityrus
is asked by Timetas to sing, but excuses himself on account of his age,
and begs that the author of the request, who has become recently
distinguished by a victory over Mopsus, will himself perform the task,
taking aa his subject the death of their common friend. 'l'imetas com·
