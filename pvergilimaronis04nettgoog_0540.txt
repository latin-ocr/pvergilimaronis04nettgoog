DIDAOTIG POETS OF ROME. 421

having been transcribed from an old MS. hy Sertorius Quadrimanue.
More ambitione than the former, to which however it is indebted for
several lines, it professes in its exordium 1ο 10 110 work ot Ovid, who
speaks 01 himself 00 led 1ο 110 subject by the scenas ot his exile ε 101
though the linas in which 110 profession is made are not without
ability, those who should credit it would be compelled to suppose that
Ovid’s removal from Rome had made him forget the quantity of the

first syllable of “ dirigo,” 00 10 00010000 to addresa Glaucus—

“ Quare sl veteris 0100001 vestigia moris,
Si precibus homiuum flectuntur numius ponti,
Huc 011010, dirigasque pedes, umerosque natantis.”

The date of Serenus Sammonicus is at any rate 0001100 thau that ot
Nemesianus, though it ie questioned whether he is to be identified with
a person of that name, “ 00100 libri,” says Spartianus, “plurimi ad
doctrinam exstant,'’ who was putto death by Caracalla, 00 with his
sou, the preceptores tbe younger Gordian, aud the valued friend 01
Alexander Severus. His worlr, however, De Medicina Praecepto, iu
1115 hexameters, is not properly a didactic poem 01 011, 101 merely a
medical treatise in matre. These who are fond ot classical parallels ,
may compare it with Gatins' lecture 1ο Horace: but 1ο others it will
seem a prodnct 01 110 second cbildhood 01 literature, when subjecta,
which, since prose composition existed, have always been treated iu
prose, are set to tune again by 110 perverse ingenuity of grammarians.
'Phe only part which appears 10 have any poetical pretensiou is the
opening.

Inventumque tuum prompto comitare favore.
Tuque potens artis, reducem qui tradere vitam

Qui colis Aegeas, qui Pergama, quique Epidaurum,
Qui quondam placidi tectus sub pella dmeouls
