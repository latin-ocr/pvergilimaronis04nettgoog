Et penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos.

En umquam patrios longo post tempore finis,

Pauperis et tuguri congestum caespite culmen,

Post aliquot, mea regna videns, mirabor aristas i

Impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit? το
Barbarus has segetes? en, quo discordia civis

Produxit miseros! his nos consevimus agros!
