work which was read by virgil, or the more mutiens speculation of
Colouel Mure,¹ who refers the uuiucorporated fragments to some oi
the lost poema traditionally ascribed to Hesiod, such es the Astronomy
sud the Maxima of Cheiron Possibly Propertius⁸ may heve been
thinking of these when he addressed Vir-gil as repeating in song the
directions ot the old Ascraeas hard, and telling oi the plain in which
the coru-crop grows greenoet, the slope on which the grapa clusters
best, though it is equally likely that ha simply intended to sckuow·
ledge the Georgica as a Hesiodic poem, characteriziug them, not by
any thing iu Hesiod, but by their own argument aa sammed up in tha
exordium of the Firat Book. In any caso, however, we may be sure
that what we have lost bears no proportior in velue, aa a means of
estimating the relations of Hesiod and Virgil, to what we have pre-
served. The recovery of the whole of Hesiod's poetry would douhtless
supply us with illustratione oi many passages iu the Georgius: it is not
needed to iudicate aud shadow forth, though it might possibly deepeu,
the contrast between tha poet of Augustam Βοωο and the half-mythical
minata-el oi Boeotia.

'Phe Works and Dsys are the earliest classical representative oi that
species of poetry which is known as the Didactic, e variety which hes
been extensively cultivated iu later times, and may be said to heve
flourished in Englsnd down to the eud oi the last century. Yet it is
not too much to essert that a critic who wished to justiiy the disisvour
with which didactic poetry ia regarded hythe writers and readers oi the
present day might find his strongest arguments iu an examinatior oi
Hesiod’s poem not by attemptiug to derogato from its characteristic
excellences, but by using it as a witness to show thet the class oi com·
positions oi which it is a specimen was not calculated ior permaneres.
Colouel Mure is not exceeding bis customary modesty of theorizing
when he delivsrs it as his opinion that⁴ “ hed prose composition been
already popular iu Hesiod's time, the Works and Days would probably
have been ambodied in that form.’' It is indeed obviously the product
of a time when verse was the one mode oi formul composition, recom-
meudiug itself tc the reader's memory by its portability‚ aud to the

writer’s imagination, as differing most from that common every-day
speech which it must have seemsd impossible to invest with any artistic
msociations. Hesiod douhtless was sensiblo ol the pleasures oi u com-
poser‚ and songht for such gracas of imagery and style as lay within his
horizon ε but hie first object was to enunciate those practical rulas which
