Finally I may refer the curicus reader 10 110 long criticism cu A. 11.
243 1011.

It would be interesting 10 know whether the fourth book 01 Macro-
bius, and remarks such as those which I have quoted from 8000100,
were taken from the book 01 our rhetorical worthies, Titianus and
0010110000.ο Whether this 10 the case 00 000, there ceu be no doubt that
this style 01 criticism 10 00001 which Probus or any 01 110 older com·
mentatcrs would have been aehamed, aud 10 110 characteristic offspring
01 000 age iu which all 00001100 effert has died out.

Itis in all respecta more profitable 10 study the material common to
the Verona scholia, Philargyn'us, Macrobius, and Servius: material
which 1 suppose to be, so to speak, the deposit which the scholarship
01 110 first and second century had 1011. 10 dealing with this matter it
isnoticeable that the commentery 01 8000100, as compared with the
notes 01 Macrobius or the Verona scholia, tende 100110001010, 10
0001011, and 10 omit the names 01 authorities. Servius is on the whole
0 sonnd, bnt he is not a 1011 commentater; aud we should 10 fortunate
indeed could we exchange all his work 100 110 Verona scholia in their
complete form. The 00100 01 110 commentary 10 derived almost
entirely from what it preserves 01 110 earlier 1100000 scholarship; and

the amount 01 1110, judging by what a comparative method enables us
to detect, 10 001 inconsiderable.
