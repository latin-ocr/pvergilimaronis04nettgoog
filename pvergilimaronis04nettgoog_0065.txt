Several objections of his to points cf detail in Virgil’s languagea
in his management of his story have been preserved by Gelliuss
Macrobius. He took exception to the word assasse in 1111. 6. 76, wh
Servius appeals to Probus in the poet’s defence (comp. Gall. 9. 6.).

historia, 111 crinis auferendus 111 morientibus, ignoratur‚” are
words quoted in Macrobius 5.19.2. 11 was naturally replied t
Virgil was simply following the Alcestis of Euripides. Not mi
more attention need be paid to his complaint that Virgil in Aen
488 has made Aeneas shoot a bird sacred to his own mother, cr to
criticisms (preserved by Gellius 9. 10.) of the wording of Aeneid 8.4

AEMILIUS ASPER.⁴

It is uncertain whether this distinguished scholar lived before
after Probus. 'Phe fact that uo mention is made cf him by Suetor
in his work lle Ilicet-ibas Grammaticis makes very strongly in fav
cf the later datc; nor can there be said to be any positive evidence
the earlier one. It ia true that in a note of the Verona scholia
A. 9. 373, Asper is said to have raised a question with regard tc
· word satiastris which was auswered by Probus: but this need pr
no more thau that Asper, if he knew of the answer given by Prol
was not satisfied by it. Nor can auythiug be inferred from the i
that on A. 10. 539 Asper’s reading amnis is mentioned before t
preferred by Probus, albis. 'Phe conjecture of Bergk, who would r
Ἀσπερος for Ἀπερος in Suidas’ notice of Heraclides Ponticus, oc
only be accepted were' it certain on other munds that Asper live(
the reign of Claudius. Nothing again can be concluded from the,
that the commentary on the Eclogues and Georgica which bears
name of Probus quotes Asper as an authority3 for (as we shall
below) this commentary is probably in great part spurious.

However this may be, Asper was the author of a regular comment
not only on Virgil but on Terence and Sallust. A consider
number of his notes are preserved, apparently in their original ft
in the Verona scholia. Others are to be found in Philargyrius
Servins3 and I have little doubt that much more of Asper's wor
embadied in the commentary of Servius than its author choosci
acknowledge. For ii we compare the notes which the Verona sol
expressly aesign to Asper with the corresponding notes in Servius
constantly find that the latter has virtually the same comment 11
abridged form, and without any hiut of 111 source. From this fact
