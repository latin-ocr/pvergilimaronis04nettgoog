Charisius, and Prieeian: theee are oleae oborto, dooere, emto, eolo,
emm, oreo, palomtee, ponae, papaver, enar, eol, eaopaie, and etiope.

Beturning‚ theu, to Nonius, we find that hie alphabetico] arrange·
ment, hir grammatiool treatment, and the considerable number of
iustanoee common to both writers, euggeet a olore relation between hie
third book and the rouroee ol Prieoinn l, pp. 169-71, andarelation oi
eome kind, though not nearly eo oloee, between thio book and the
nonroee ot Charisius, pp. 70-109.

We know that Prohue and Caper treated separately of the question
of doubtful gender (de dotto peueritm). I think it, then, extremely
probable that Noniue’ third book ie neither more nor leee than an
extruet lrom the work oi oue or the other ol theee writers.⁸ Cher-iuius,
on the other hund, in tho eeotion whioh we bave been oonefflering, wne,
I believe, drawing either direotly or indireotly upon Pliny'e books
dotis· renuntio 'Phio 1 think probable, not merely from the expreee
mention of Pliuy’e nome, but eleo from the range of the quotatione.
And the ooiuoidenoee between Charisius and Nonius Iwonld explain
by enppoeing that Probne either drew upon Pliny'e treotieo, whioh he
may well bave done, ae he outlived Pliny hy eome years, or thot he
ueed thesemo authorities. (Gomp. Prieo. 1, p. 393, Plinium etProbmn.)

Before qnitting thie part of my enbjeot, I would obeerve that there
ere rarione pointe of ooutaet between the third book of Nonius end
Verrius Flaooue. It ie remarkable, eleo, that Verrius ie often cited by
Charisius iu the eeotion eo often alluded to. 'Phe natural inferenoe ie
that Prohno and Pliny both drew lergely upon the lexioon and the
grammatioal treatieee of Verriue.

There are eleo remarks on other rare or antiqueted verbal forme, ae

remarkable coincidence between the liete oi deponent verbo illustrated

by Nonius, and perte of the eighth book of Prieoion. We are oon·
