156 GEORGIGA.

troduetion to Book 4 would support the hypothesis ci more extensive
changes, though we need not suppose thamin any cese to have been such
as seriously to interrupt the composition of the Aeneid. Whether the
poet’s resideuce at Naples (G. 4. 564), which is mentioued es il it syn·
chroniued with Caesar's progreee in the East, is ιο be understood as
referring to the entire time during which the Georgius were written,
or only to their completior, is not cleer. Μι*1 Keightlsy remarks that
the whole aspect oi the poem is Campanian ι others have maintained ee
decidedly that it ie Mantuae. The lenguage in G. 2. 197 would suit
Mantua better, ae Ι have there observed, while Spohu argues that
southern Italy cau hardly heve beon sufficieutly tranquil ιο induce
Virgil to fix his resideuce there before 718. It would be easy to
suggest that the poem was written partly et Mantua partly, if not
principally, at Naples: bnt perhaps we heve not deta enough sven for

. so uuambitioue a hypothesis.
