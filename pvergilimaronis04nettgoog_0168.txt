BUOOLIOA. Eoi.. IV. 51

the marriage ci Antonius with Octavia, aud the uuion oi Octavianm with Scribords
bed taken place not long before. [The most ascicutaommentators, iiwe may judge
hythe notes in Macrobius (S. 3. 7. 1.) Servius, and the Bernescholia, were not agreed
whether the poem was to be referred to Octavianus, or ιο οιιο οι other oi Pollio's sons]
One oi these, called Saloninus irom his fathers capture oi Salona in Dalmatia, died
in his iniancy, while the other, 0. Asinius Gallus, who is said to have spoken oi
himselito Asconius Pedianus aa the pcrson meant, lived ιο be discussed by Augustus
as his possible successor (Tac. Α. l. 13), aud finally leli a rictim ιο the jealousy oi
Tiberius (ib. 6, 23). οοιιιιιιιιιιι’ marriage issucd iu the birth oi Julia: Οοιιιιιιιί
οιιιιιι, ιι ιι was ever born, was the child ιιοι οι Antonius, but oi Marcellus, her
former husband, by whom she was pregnant st the timaei her second marriage.
Any οιΙ these hirths, so iar es we can see, may hare appeared at the time to a
courtly οι· enthusiastic poet a sufficiant oentre round which ιο group tha hopes
already assumed to ba rising in men's minds, eud though the next three years may
bava mede a differeuco iu this respect, the poem would still οοιιιιιιιιο ιο be in its
general features the embodimcnt oi e feeling not yet extinguished, aud ss such
might well be publiehed along wilh the other Eclogues The peace oi Brundisium
itseli uas ιιοι ιο ιιιιιοιι the cause οι this enthusiasm aa the occasion οι iis menites·
totino-the partini satisfaction οι a yoaruing which had long been ielt, ιιοι merely
the haurient aaakening oi desires hitherto dormant. How iar such hopes moy
hare been connected with the expectation oi a Messiah opens a wide question. The
coincidence between Virgil's language aod that oi the Old Testameut prophete is
sufficiaotly striking: but it may be doubted whether virgil uses aoy image ιο
which a classioal parallel cannot be found.

'l'he allusions ιο the propheciae oi the Sibyl aad to the doctrina oi tho Annus
Magnus will be iouod explained ιιι their places. Βοιιιο features οι thapsam, which
seem to doeerre attention, are noticed iu the nota on v. 18.
