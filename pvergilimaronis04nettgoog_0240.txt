seven Eclogues bemuse, according to Servius, only seven of Virgil's
are rustic proper. Wernsdorf had passed lightly over au apparent
objection to his theory founded on the similarity oi passages in the
earlier Eclogues ιο passages in the later, alleging other instaures iu
which poete repeat themselves: Haupt contende that this apolugy does
not touch the ease of tha third and niuth Eulogues, the latter uf which
is an obvious though unskiliul imitation οι ιιο former. Having thus,
as he conceives‚ shown that the poems in question cannot be by Cal-
purnius, he endeavours ιο prove that they are rightly attributed to
Nemesianus, pointing out some resemblances between them and Neme-
sianus’ Cynegetiea, and urgiug that the silence of Vopiscus is not of
that kind which would establish a negative. He shows that the MS.
evidence for divided authorship, instead oi resting on a single copy, ie
really supported by two othere, oue of them the beet oi all, the Nea·
politan, and by the traditiones a third; while he considers ιιο iuscrip-
tion of Calpurnius’ Eulogues to Nemesianus to have arisen from a con·
fusion between the concluding ‘Explicit Calpurnii bucolicon' aud the
opening ‘Aurelii Nemesiani Carthaginiensis bucolicon incipit‚’ which
would follow it immediately, and cites other instauoes oi similar amal·
gamations by transcribere. Iastly, ιο separatus the two poete, who
had been previously supposed ιο ιο contemporaries, by a guli of more
thau two centurias, leaving Nemesianus at the date to which he is
commonly fixed by external evidence, the date uf the emperor Carus
and hie sous, and advauciug Calpurnius, whose ordinary dats rests e
partly on the inscription to Nemesianus mentioued above, partly on an
arbitrary identification oi him with a certain J unius Calpurnius, named
by Vopiscus as the emperor's ‘magister memoriae,’ to the time of Nero,
to whose reign he points out several allusione in the Eulogues. With-
out presumiug to affirm or deny the validity of thie chain² of reasoning,
Ι may perhaps be allowed eo far ιο adopt Haupt’s position ae ιο epealr
of Nemesianus as the author of four out of the eleven pastorale.

Corydon, who, as they take refuge from the heat in a cave sacred to
Faunus, observa some verses carved on a hecub-tres, apparently, eo it

Calpurnius ineouclusive, and contende that the allusion to the emperor at the end oi
the seventb Eulogue “points much better to Domitian.’' On the other hand, Mr.
Grsswell believes the emperor in question to be the youngest Gordian.
