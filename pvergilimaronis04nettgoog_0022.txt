LIFE OF VIRGIL. xix

written in his boyhood as an epitaph on a brigand Ballista, the· master
oi a school oi gladiatore ε

‘¹ Monte sub hoo lepidum tegitur Ballista sepultus;
Nocte die tutum carpe, viator, iter.'’¹

Suetonius says that among his other studies Virgil paid attention to
medicine and astrology.² A notice in the Verona scholia informa us

also that he studied philosophy under Siron, a celebrated Epicurean.⁸
There are some pretty lines in the collection ot the minor poema (ruri

λεπτόν) attributed to Virgil, in which the boy expresses the deligbt
with which he is abandoning rhetoric and grammar, aud even poetry,
for philosophye

‘⁸ Ite hinc, inanes, ite, rhetorum ampullae,
Inflata rore non Achaico verbaz
Et ros, Stiloque Tarquitique varroque,
Scholastieorum natio madens pingui,
Ite hinc, inane cymhalon iuventutis.
nuque o mearum cura* Sexte, curarum
Vale, Sabine: iam valete, tormosi;
Nos ad beatos vela mittimus portus,
Magni petentes docta dicta Sironis,
vitamque ab omni vindicabimus cura.
lte hinc, (lamense. vos quoque ite iam, saue
Dulcrs (lamense, (nam, fatebimur verum,
Duloes fuistis); et tamen meas cartas
Rerisitote, sed pudenter et raro.''

No scholare, as far es I arn auare, see any objection to accepting
these lines as genuine. Ii they are so, they are an interesting testi-
mony to the aspiration for philosophicsl culture which Virgil expresses
again in the second Georgic, and which never leit him.

Like Horace, Virgil long ielt the influence of the Epicurean system,
to a part ot which at least he expresses his adherence in a passage in
the first Georgic (v. 415 toll). And we may well believe that it was
partly due to the teaching oi Siron that Virgil conceived the deep
admiration for Lucretius which no careful critic has failed to detect in
his writings.

Suetonius says that attha age ot sixteen Virgil wrote the Outcc,‘

¹ Suetonius 17: Servius. ² lttd. 15.

³ Ecl. 6. 10. ⁴ Came, Haupt

¹ Suetonius 17, “deinde (scripsit) catslepton et priapia ct epigrammata et diras,
item Cirim et Culicem cum esset annorum xvi. Scripsit etiam, de qua ambigitur,
Aetnam.” Servius: “scripsit etiam septem sire octolibros hos: (lirin, Aetnam, Guli-
cem, Priapeia, catalapton, epigrammata, Oopam, diras.’' Idoubt whether these two
statcmeuts cau be taken as independent. 'l'bere is considerable critical difficult
