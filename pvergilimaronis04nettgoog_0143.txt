24 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Spem gregis, apl silice in nuda conixa reliquit. 15
Saepe malum hoc nobis, si mens non laeva fuisset,

De caelo tectas memini praedicere quercus.

Sed tamen, iste deus qui sit, da, Tityre, nobis.

T. Urbem, quam dicunt Romam, Meliboee, putevi
Stultus ego huie nostrae similem, quo saepe solemus 20
Pastores ovium teneros depellere 101110.

Sic canibus catulos similes, sic matribus haedos

Noram, sic parvis componere magna solebam.
