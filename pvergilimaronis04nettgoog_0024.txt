LIFE OF VIRGIL. xxi

and a home to him and his father. 'l'his poem has as good a claim ιο
acceptauce as any in the collection; but the thirteenth, ιιο author of
which speaks oi himself as a soldier aocustomed to hard campaigniug,
cannot possibly be by Virgil. Τιο third (Aspice quem calido subnixam
glorie regno) may very well, asI have argued elsewhere,⁸ apply to
Phraates, and iu that case must belong ιο ιιο year 32 s.c., the thirty·
eighth oi Virgil's age. Considering this fact it can hardly, perhaps,
be pronounoed worthy of him. of the sixth and the ιοοιιιιι all that
can be scidis that they are lampoons in the manner oi Catullus.
'I'wo poema (4 and 11) are addressed apparently to Octavius Musa, an
historian of note. The authorship both oi these and oi the rest oi the
collection remains at present uncertain.

But, whatever be ιιο οοοο with regard to these poems, we must
look to the Ecloguee and Georgica ii we would learu anythiug oi the
studies and political leanings oi Virgil’s early manhood. Το take
the last point first, it must never be forgotteu that Virgil's boyhood
was passed in ιιο full blane oi Julius ansar’s glory. Virgil was a
boy oi fifteen when Caesar invaded Britain, au expedition which im-
pressed the fancy even of the hostile Catullus. And there were
nearer ties which bound Virgil’s native country to Caesar. Iu 49 ao·
(the twenty-first of Virgil’s age) Caesar, who had for niueteen years
been patron oi Gallia Transpadana, conferred ιιο Roman citizenship
on its inhabitants. The whole career oi the Dictator must, in fact,
have deeply impressed the imagination oi the young poet. The
literary men oi the previous generation had mostly espoused the cause
oi the republic; but a change, for which ιιο course oi events quite
sufficiently accounts, began with Sallust, Virgil, and Varius. If the
fifth Eologue is rightly referred to Julius Caesar, we may take this
poem as ¹well as the conclusion oi the first Georgic as Virgil’s tribute
ιο the man whom he regarded as the saviour ot his country.

Turning now ιο Virgil's carly studies, it is clear from the Eclogues
and the Georgics that they were mainly devoted to the Alexandrian
poete, aud among the Roman poets to Lucretius (witness the sixth
Eologne), to Helvius Cinna, aud to Varius. These last he expressly
mentions as writers whose tame ιο would fain emulate if he could.⁰
Helvius Cinna, whose poem ou Smyrna, admired ot Catullus, had
occupied him niue years, is said ina notice preserved by Philargyrius
to have given the occasion for Horace’s precept “ nouumque prematur
in annum.’' We may conjecture that he was admircd by Virgil as
settiug au example of severe learning and minute study oi form.
