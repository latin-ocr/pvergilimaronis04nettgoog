of Macrobius. Macrobius, who held high offioes of state in 399, 410,
and 422 aa, probably wrote his Saturnalia at the eud of the fourth or
beginning of the fifth century. Tho dialogue, however, is in Platonio
and Ciceronian fashion, thrown some twenty years back, being supposed
to take place before the death of Praetextatus (385 aa). Servius is
spoken of as at that time a man who bad only recently adopted the
profession of teaching, but who had already acquired a high reputatiou
both for learning aud modeety (Sat. 1. 2. 15). He is described further
(ib. 6. 6. 1), as occupied every day in explaining Virgil to the &man
youth, aud the duty of answering hostile criticisms upon Virgil is, to
a large extem, assigned to him.

Iam glad to find that M. Thomas has come to the same conclusion
es that for whichI have already coutended, that the Servius of the
Saturnalia stands in no real relation to the Servius of our oommentary,
except iu so far as the notes on Virgil in Macrobius cau be shown to
be ultimately derived from the same sources as those iu the commentary
of Servius. 'l'he idea that Macrobius is quoting from the actual com-
mentary of Servius cannot,1 think, any longer be defended. All iu-
ternal evidence points, as Ihaveattempted to show, in another direction.
Macrobius was himself, in all probability, using old commentaries and
treatises now lost, which were the source of many a note in Philargyrius
and Servins; and it was only natural, from a literary point of view,
that he should pay Servius the compliment of assiguing to him the
duty of exponnding this Virgilian learning.

Whether the commentary of Servius which we now possess was
published at the time when the Saturnalia were written is a point

which I do not think there is evidence to decide. If we take the
language held in the Saturnalia as seriously affecting the question, we
must conclude thatin the year 380, or thereabouts‚ Servius was known ⁴
not as a writer but only as a very learned teacher, and that his com-
mentary was not published until after the publicationes the Saturnalia.
But the character of that dialogus makes it unsafe to build much upon
its language in a matter of this kind. It may be that Macrobius knew
our commentary, and yet purposely put fuller and elcarer expositione
into the mouth of his Servius. Itis also possible that the commentary
as we have it was not published until the beginning of the fifth
century au.

The existing commentary falls into two parts, oue of which may
for convenience be termed the Vulgate; while the other consists of
certain additions to the Vulgata, found iu manuscripts of the ninth
aud tenth centurias, and in quality equal either to the Vulgata or
to the commentary of Philargyrius. These additione were published
with the Vulgate in the year 1600 by Daniel, since whose time the
