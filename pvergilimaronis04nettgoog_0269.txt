152 GEORGICA.

poet from msslring ihs hoilsome nshnre oi the tusk ιο which he cells
lhe former, that he everywhere iskes occasion ιο bring it οοι into
strong lighi, dwelling on it us in ilself s source oi enthusissm‚ end
urging those whom he sddresses ιο spere no peine ιο mulce ihe work
thorongh. Observe the form inho which he throws his very ἤτοι
οοοιοοοο, us soon us the ceremony oi invocslion is over, and hhe
pruciieul perh ci the Georgius begun. “In ihc down oi¹ spring,
when icy streame triokle melting from the hoer mounluins, eud the
crumbling clod breaks ihs chain οι lhe wesh wind’s touch, even then Ι
would fain see tho plough driven deep hill the bull groens again, sud
lho shere rubbed iu the furrow till il shines.” All thus is orcomenhsl,
or, ss it msy be called, poeticul iu ihc lether pari of the sentence ihc
deep-driving oi the plough, lhe groening ol the bnlL the shining of
hhe share, uends direclly ιο one point, hurd sud unspsring lsbonr. The
seme spirit msy be discovered in the nexl sentence, conoesled iu ihc
single word ‘seusih‚' which deuotes hhe leying bere, es ih were, of the
ncrve oi the soil to the two opposite influences by e lhorough plough·
ing twice in euch seuseu A few lines further on we heve s passage
which οοι only eniorcos strongly the practicul duhy oi work, but siches
the lhcologioul ground (so ιο nume it) on which il rests. “Remember”
·-such iu effect is Virgil’s lunguuge-“lhst the special sphiludes oi
ihs soil must be eludied. Differenu regions heve different producis:
eoru is more congenicl ιο οοο, ihe vine ιο snolher. Such,'’ he goes on
ιο ssy, “is the chuin of law, such the ehernsl covensnh, wilh which
neture hus bound cerheiu elimes, from the day when Deucalion firsl
hurled his slones ou ihc unpeopled globe, siones whence sprung msn’s
rece, hurd ss they.'’ In the fourth Eclogue he had seid that when
lhe golden age oi tho future should οι length be fully consummeted
the occupatione of the ssilor and the furmer would cesse together: ull
lsnds would produce ell things: the ground should not feel the hurrow,
nor the vineyurd the pruning-hook: the slurdy ploughman ιοο (mark
the epilheu) should οι length set his bullocks free from lhe yoke. Bul
suebis οοι the dispensshion under which men now live. The appro-

pristion oi certain produce ιο certain soils isexpressly intended ιο multe
lubour necessary: end the sums order oi things which ordsincd lebonr
ordeined frames oi sloue sud ihews of iron ιο grspple wilh il. thi
is the morel? thh, bui that msn und bessi should occepi hhe lsw oi
their being, und work wilh ull their might? “Ergo uge‚” concludes

the poet, “Ergo nge, torreo
Pingue solum primis externplo ο mensibus anni
Fortes invertunt tauri, glaebasque lucentis

Pulvsrulenle coquet maturis solibus sestul'
