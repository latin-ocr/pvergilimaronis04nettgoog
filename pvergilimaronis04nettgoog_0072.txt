THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxix

aud assort that much ol them iu, in the last resort, distinctly traceable
to Pliny and Probus. Taking the third hook (De Iadiecretie cecatus)
first, we may observe that the subject ol doubtful gender had occu-
pied the attention ol grammarians in the first century aa. So much
may he inferred from the languago oi Quintilian (9. 3. 6), who speaks
aa il he had manuale before him in which the subject was treated.
One of these may have boen the book ol Probus, De dubiis peceribus
(probably part of his Silvo Observationum), cited by Priscian (1, p. 169,
171 Keil). Iret us procoed to consider the relation between thie work
and the third book ot Nonius.

Priscian, in the passage already quoted, gives a list which bo took,
as he says, from the treatiseu of Caper and Probus de dubiis perscribas.
This list is partly alphabetical. “Vetustissimi in multis, ut diximus,
supra dictarum terminationum inveniuntur confudisse genera, nulla
significationis differentia coacti, sed sola anctoritate, ut bio et haee
oeperpo, aleae, oreae, adeps vel adipes, clmrtc, cardo, οίηίο vel einer,
cervia, collis, oruc, cole, cupressos, platanus, populus, loom, aquilo,
orinia emtam, colae, bio et bueo ausam, clunia, bloet Ῑιοοο muscia (?)‚
callia fornae, frutex, pree, frons frontis, tio et doec hamne, imbrex,
lutee. Accius “ non calida latice lautus: ” lembus, linter, lepos, apem,
leo, pampinos, perdiu, bio et boec palumbes, bic et boec saec, medem
ὄπρότονος, coemes, supparos περιώμιον ot bocoapparcm, senec, stirpe, terrie
d δολός, taras.t'2trie,umue‚torq1oes,tmma, vespm, ts· ct boe cepres.
This list is alphabetioal, with three exceptione. Alter capream come
platanus, popalus, laum, aquila: after lepus, opaea and afta Tibris,
omnio: a fact to which I shall reenr in a moment.

This list only includes instanoes of confusion between the masculine
and feminine gendere. Priscian goes on to give instaures ol con·
fusion between the masculine and neuter, or the masculine, feminine,
and neuter: patiar, memor, plorans, fretae, ἆονοοο, pelas, Hister,
Rheneia, Pereprus, Metaurus, Iberus, Vulturnus, Oceanus, iubar, liquor,
papaver, penas, pecua, rotie, secus, oyseooe, ecl.

These liets are (with tho exceptione noticed) alphabetical, and so
lar resemble the third book of Nonius. And ol the words thus
catalogued by Priscian in thie passage, thirty-one out of seventy·two
ura to be found in Nonius. I might have said thirty-one ont of sixty.
eight, lor the words platones, populas, laurus, animumanimum
absent in Nonius), are intruded in Priscian in a place where, alpha·

beticelly, they have no right to stand, the alphabetico] order proceed-

ing properly from cupressea to crinis.
Priscian distinotly tells ue that he hae taken hie lists from Caper aud

Probus: and it would, therefore, be easy to infer that the third book
ol Nonius aleo comes from the same sources. But the question is
