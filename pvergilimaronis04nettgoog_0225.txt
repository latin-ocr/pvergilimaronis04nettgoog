66.] ‘ Desine plura, puer,’ 5. 19. ‘ Iu-
stat,’ reminding Lycidas that the business
admits of no delay‚ not even of singing or
talking as they welk along. Some varie-
ties in Ribbeck’s MSS. seem to show that
there was once a reading ‘ nunc, quod
nunc instat.'

as Moeris' master (3. 3 note), or, in rela-

EXOUBSUS ΟΝ THE ΒΕΕΑΤΙΙὲἏῗΟΟΘΕῐ-ΪΞΗΕ FIRST ΤΟ THE NINTH

[Tun first Eclogue represents Virgil as restored ιο the possession of his estate, while
the niuth complains of his violent expulsion from it. This fact was explained by
Servius, and is still explained, Ι think, by all medem critica, by the hypothesis that
after the poet had been restored by Octavianus he was again expelled, and afterwards,
at some time not specified, again reinstated.

But it may be doubted whether this notion of a double ejection rests on sufficient
evidence. The two poems in question lend no real support to it, but, if anything, rather
the reverse. 'l'he ninth Eelogue represents virgil as saying that a missortune had
come upon him of which he had never had any apprehension, ‘⁶ quod numquam
veriti sumus ; ” strange language, surely, had he been ejected only a few months
before. The poem proceeds: ‘⁴ 1 had heard that Menalcas’ poetry had proved the
salvation of his estate,'’ “omnia carminibus vestrum servasse Menalcan.'' ‘⁸ Yes,
and it was a mere rumour‚ for the din of arms has silenced poetry.'' These words do
not necessarily, Ι think, imply more than that Virgil had hoped at one time ιο
retain his farm, but that it had after all been taken away. It is indeed quite likely
that when the first order came for the confiscation of the Mantuan territory, Virgil
made interest with Pollio for at least the temporary preservation of it, and that thus
arose the rumour alluded ιο. Βιιι if Virgil had really gone to Rome before the ninth
