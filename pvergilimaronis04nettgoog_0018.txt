ΤΟ THE SEGOND EDITION. xv

heve geined something, though his novelties of interpretation
seem ιο me frequently untrue, und his conjecturel deviatione from
the received text unfortrmete. Iheve consulted eleo the school
editione by Mr. A. H. Bryce end Mr. G. D. Yongo, end perte of s
critique by Ameis on pesseges in Wagner’s ond Ledewig’s editions
of the Eulogues end Georgius, under the title of “Spicilegium
explicationem Vergilianumm.” I sm sorry thet I em obliged to

go to prees before the eppeursnue of Dr. Kennedy's promised
school edition.

I have uurefnlly etudied the veluuble review of the first edition
of thie volume by my friend ΜΓ. Munro, in the Journal uf Olus·
sicul end Suered Philology, frequently sdopting his rievs, end
never rejecting them without full consideration. And I heve

introduced not s few suggestions from e body of remarks hindly
forverded to me by Mr. Bleclsburn‚ Restm of Selhem in Sussex,
vho speslrs not only es e student of Virgil, bnt os s mon sucus·
tomed to country pursuits. While, however,l trust thet from
these end other sources various improvements will be discovered
in the explanatory pert of the present edition, it is right ιο ssy
thet it vill be found to be substantielly unaltered.

As subsidiery vorke, bearing on the subject of the Georgius,
I heve consulted Dickson's “Husbendry of the Ancients,” end
Dr. Duuheny's recently published ‘⁴ Lecturus on Romen Hus-
bsndry 3 '’ but my knowledge hes,I seer, not been elvsys sufficient
to enable me ιο use them with effect The grammor to which
I heve most frequently referred is Madvig’s3 the lexicon, For·
cellini’s.

The editions of the classice to which I have referred heve been
in general the best end luteet, when my librery happened to con·
tuin them. For the Greek dremstists Ι heve followed Dindorf ;
for Pindsr, Bergk or Schneidewim for Hesiod, commonly Gottling3
lor Dion (lessius, Reimarus3 for Xenophon· end Appium, the edi·
tione published in Teubner's series. For Plautus‚I heve followed
those editions where the lines ure numbered by Acts end Scenes,
not es preferring that practice, which sppeers not to heve been
sanctioned by untiquity, but because neither Ritsuhl nor Fleckeisen,
who udopt the other plen, hus completed his edition3 for Pro-
pertius, Psley3 for Lucretius, Leuhmenn3 for the other Lutin
