LIFE OF VIRGIL. xxv

In the year 31 came the battle of Actium in 29 Octavienus returned
to Itely from the Eust. virgil, who with the assistance of hieeceuus
resd the Georgica to him ut Atella, seems ιο heve intended et this time
to write un epic poem iu celebretion of his exploits. The pects were
busy upon the battle of Actium, eud Virgil was for the time caught by
the general enthusiesm. But he cuuuot have entertained the idea ior
long. Idke Horace, he, for some reason mother, seems ιο heve
shrunk from the direct celebretion of the acte of eny person: thus in
the sixth Eulogue he refuses to perform this service for Verus. Per-
hsps he thought, like Horace, thet Verius wus the right men to treet
such subjecto: Scriberis Venio sortis et laostiem Victor, Maeonii comicie
aliti. However thie mey be, he preferred u wider field and turned his
thoughts to the Aeneid.

He wus engaged for the rest of hia life, ten years, on this great epic‚
which he never lived to hnish. Suetonius⁹ preses-ves u very importent
notice regerding the menner in which the Aeneid wes composed.
Virgil drufted it in prose, and then wrote the books in no particular
order, but just as the fancy took him. 'l'his ieet fully accounts for tho
numerous inconsistsncies in the namutive us we beve it. The uerrutive
of the wonder-inge of Aenees in the third book is not to be reconciled
with thet given in the first end fifth3 the fifth interferes with tho
course of events es numated in the fourth end sixth‚ end is inconsistent
with the sixth iu its eccount of the death of Palinurus.

There seeum no doubt thet the third book wes written before the
second. For iu the second Creusa foretells ιο Aeneus thet he is
destined to come to the lund of the 'siben while in the third he is
represented as ucfing in entire forgetfulness of this prophecy: efsct
eusily explained if we suppose thet the second book wes written
efter the third. For the rest, there are very few notes of time ιο eid
us in determining how Virgil distributed his work over the ten years
he vves able to give to it. He must very soon efter beginning his
lebours have reed peris of the new poem to his friends. In u poem
written iu or shout 26 so. (3. 26), Propertius has the well-,known
lines-

‘⁸ Gedite Remum scriptores, cedite Grui,
Nescio quid maius nuscitur Iliede‚”

which show thet he was one of the friends who were admitted by
Virgil ιο listen end criticise.¹ I heve elsewhere’ endeavoured to

⁹ 23, “Aeneide prosu prius cretione formatum digestsmque in xii. libros porticu·
istim componere instituit, prout liberet quidque et nihil in ordinem arripiam

¹ Suetonius 33, “recitavit οι pluribus, sed neque frequenter et cu fereda quibus
ambigebst, quo megin iudicium homiuum experiretur.”
