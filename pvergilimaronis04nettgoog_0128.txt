INTRODUGTION. 9

'I'he introduction oi men called Meliboeus end Tityrus talking about
Rome leaves us nc roem to wonder at any further mixture oi incon·
grnities. Yet the lengths to which thie confusion is pushed have been
overlooked by the majority ol scholars3 nor am 1 aware oi any one,
with the exception oi a writer in the Quarterly Review and Mr.
Keightley,' who basset the matter in its true light. When Castel-
vetro, in the sixteenth century, asserted that the iavoorite trees oi the
Eclognes, the beech, the ilex, the chestuut, and the pine, doynot grew
abent Mantua, subsequent critice were ready to rsply⁸ that the features
oi the country may have changed in the lapse ol centurias, and that
surely Virgil must know best. But such reasoning will hardly a'vail
against the absence of the green caves in which the shepherd lies, or
the briary crags irem which his goats hang, or the loity mountains
whose lengthening sbadows remind him oi evening. These are the
unmistakable features of Sicily, and ne illusion ol historieal criticism
will persuade ns that they have changed their places, strangeas itis
to meet them {in conjunction with real Mantuan scenery, with the
flinty soil oi Andes, and the broad, lazy current of the Mincio. The
actual Mantua is surrounded by a lake: its pastoral counterpart, like
Shakspeare's Bohemia‚ seems to be on the sea, the stillness oi whose
waters enables the shepherds to sing undistnrbed, as in Theocritus it

ν forma a contrast with the unresting sorrow citha love-sick anchan-

tress. The same rule, il rule it can be called, is observed in the
manners and institutione ol the shepherds: there is the Italian
clement, and there is the Sicilian, added, as it were, to make it bucolic.
'l'be Pales of the Italicus and the Apollo Nomios oi the Greeks, as Mr.
Keightley again points out, retire together irom the country, which
the death oi Daphnis has left desolate: the two high-days oi the
shepherds’ calendar are the Greek festival oi the Nympbs and the
Roman Ambarvalia. It seems not improbable that a similar account
is to be given of the social position oi the shepherds themselves, who,
though living on ternas oi Arcadian equality, appear to be sometimes
slaves or hirelings, sometimes independent proprietam: bnt the status
of their bretbren in Theocritus is itseli a point which is apparently
involved in some uncertainty.

Such a systematic confusion oi time, place, and circumstance, it will
be readily admitted, goesfar to justilythe way in which Virgil has
been spoken of in the opening oi this essay as the great corruptor of
