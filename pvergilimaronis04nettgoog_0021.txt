but, so far as it goes, the informatius which they eonvey correspond
ooonrately enough with that given by Suetonius.

Such are the sources from which Ι have drawn the following sho:
account 01 the life oi Virgil.

Publius Vergilius Maro was bern on the fifteenth 01 October, in tl
year 70 uo, in which Gn. Pompeius Magnus and M. Licinius Crassi
were for the first time consuls, at Andes, a papas in the territory -
Mantua.⁴ uae name Audes is Celtic,⁵ and so apparently is Vergilia
'I'he poet's father was a 11111101 humble origin. According to son
aeoormts he was aworker in pottery‚ bnt most authorities represent
him as the hired servant oi one Magius, a courier,⁶ whose danght
Magia he et length married. His mother’s name is doubtless in gn
part responsible for the mediaeval notion which made Virgil (“ Magi
filius ”) a magioian.

If we may trust the authorities mentioned by Suetonius, Virg
father managed to enrioh himself by buying up tracte of woodla
and by keeping bees. There is nothing improbable in this sta
ment, as the time when he aras thus engaged may well have b«
the era 01 the Sullan proscriptione, when land would be cheap. 11
probable that Virgil's love for the country was fostered by his ea
surroundings.

Although ol humble origin himself, Virgil‘s father, like Horat
seems to have been anxious to give his son the best education att:
able. Virgil spent his boyhood at cremona,⁷ and toolr his 1090011
there on his fifteenth birthday (Oct. 15, nc. 55), on the very
when the poet Lucretius died! By an odd coincidence, Pompeius
Crassus wera a second time consulein this year. From Creu
Virgil went to Milan, and shortly afterwards 1ο Rome. Here
studied rhetoric under the best masters,⁹ among others (if we
believe tha short biography given in two Barna manuscripts) Epic·
who also numbered Antonius and Octavianus among his pupils.
earliest specimen quoted ol his poetry is a conplet said 1ο 11111

⁴ Suetonius 2, “ in pago qni Andes dieitur et obest eMentua non procul.'' J 1
a. abr. 1948 “ Vergilius Maro in pago qui Andes dicitur, haut procul a Mantua.”
memoir attributed to Probus cells Andes a ricus, and places it some thirty
from Mantua. But Andes must have been mueh neerer to Mantua: see “Ar
Lives 01 Vergil, &c.,” p. 33.

⁵ A Gallie tribe was so called: Caes. B. G. 2. 35, and elsewhere.

⁸ Suetonius l, “quem quidem opificem figulum, plures Magi cuiusdam vt
initio mercennarium, mox ob industriam generum tradiderunt, egregieque eubsl
silvis coemendis et apibus curandis suxisse reculam.” (1 conjecture substantie
reculae.)

s Perhaps his mother Magia was a native of Cremona: o Numerius Mag
that city is mentioned by Caesar B. G. 1. 24.
