THE AN OIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. cv

commentary thus enlarged has been generally known aethe Servius of
Daniel.⁸ Scholars seem now agreed that these additional notes were
not portaf the original commentary of Servius, but were copied into
his work from a work of squal antiquity and pratensious. I offer ιιο
opinionon this question, which seems to me still open to discussion,
as even the Vulgata of Servius is not so completely homogeneous as to
exclude the hypothesis of its author having left his work in a com·
paratively undigested form.f

However the case may stand with these additions, thera is no doubt
that the Vulgata of the commentary bearirg the name of Servius is on
the whole a homogeueous work, not a mere congeries of notes acci·
dentally bearing the name of a celebrated scholar. It is true that its
author has sometimes allowed inconsisteucies to romain, as, for instance,
when in one passage, at the beginning of his notes on the Aeneid, he
quotes arma uirumque cano as the first words of the Aeneid, and two
lines below says that Virgil began differently. The same seboim, too,
is often repeated on different passages in almost the same words.
Again, the author sometimes refers to a note which he either never
wrote, or which has disappeared from our manuscripts. This case,
however, is quite exceptional. The commentary constantly refers back
to notes which really exist, an almost decisivo mark of its coming from
one hand.

It is plain, 1 think, that the commentary of Servius is the work of
an adherent of theold religion. It is not merely that its author gives
no sign of any leaning to Christianity, or knowledge of it, but that he
shows a deoided fondness for the forms and antiquities of the old
Roman worship. Taking the commentary as a whole, I am inclined to
char-acterius it as one of the works which, like the Saturnalia of
Macrobius, marks the reaction iu favour of the past, which took place

among the Roman literati at the end of the fourth and the beginning
of the fifth centurias nn.
