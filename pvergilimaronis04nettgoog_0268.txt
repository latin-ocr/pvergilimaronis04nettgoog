INTRODUOTION. 151

ception wasone which continued to dwell with him through life: the
song ol Silenus in the sixth Eelogue is a witness no less to its early
formation. In the latter, es we there saw, a cosmogony which, though
not strictly Epicurean, is exprensed throughout in Lucretian phrase·
ology, ie succeeded by a series cf mythological storius, as in Ovid’s
Metamorphoses: bnt the compromise is merely equivaleut to the
oscillatiou of mind shown iu the Georgius, between the scientifio
temper that defles death by disbelieving the future and the primitive
saith in woodgeds and nymphe. 'I'he same feeling shows iteelf in the
scattered hints of a pessimist spirit which appear even on trifling
occasions, in the reflection cn the uneqnal struggle between meu aud
nature as exemplified iu the sowing cf pulse, aud the exhortation to
the breeder of cattle to take advantage of those bright days of life
which are the first to fly.. 'I'lie general impressiou which we thus gaiuis
siugularly confirmed by Virgil's biographer, who tells us, with every
appearance cf truth, that just before his last illnees he had resolved to
speud three years abroad in polishing the Aeuoid, aud theu, for the rest
of his life, to devote himself to philosophy. Sueba teste is of course
not in itself inconsistent with a love of the exterual aspectent nature;
but it shows that, in his judgment at least, natural beauty was not bis
oue congenial clement, the only atmosphere which could iuvigorate the
pulses and sustain the wings of his fancy. His philosophioal spiratione
arethusa of an intellectual amateur rather than oi a genuine lover of
wisdom r bnt thetemperament which admits of such lukewarm devotion
is one which we should expect tc lind not in the single-minded enthu-
siast for nature, but in the many-sided cultivator of art.

The Georgius have been characterizet by Mr. Merivale¹ as the Glori-
fication cf Iiabour. Such epigrammatic judgmeuts are, from the
nature of thecam, apt to be too narrow for the facte which they pro·
fers to cover: aud a render of Virgil may perhaps be surprised to lind
an intention attributed tc the poet which does not display itseli promi-
ueutly ou the suriaee of the work. Yet I may be allowed to say that
my own examinatior of the poem, extending over a time previous as
well as subseqneut to the publication of Mr. Merivale’s criticism, has
led meto believe that the remark is scarcely less true thau pointed.
Passages may undoubtedly be shown where little or uo traca of the
feeling appears: but it can be proved to lnrk in others where its

existence hitherto would seem to have been unsuspected3 nor can 1
doubt, on the whole, that, ns I have said in a former page, it was as
strongly present to Virgil’s mind ne to Hesiod's, though it is certainly
not put forth in the same homely plain-spoken manner. So far is the
